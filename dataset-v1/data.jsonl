{"text":"[LINKEDIN] I just built this custom visual SEO editor from scratch. ❌ No advanced coding background. ❌ No dev team. ❌ No pre-made plugin. Just Claude + ChatGPT Codex + VSCode... and 8 focused hours. Here’s why: The SEO plugin we were using suddenly wanted us to upgrade just to access the “advanced features.” And I was like… what the heck?! We’re already paying and now you want us to pay more??? So, I did what any reasonable, non-technical, \"slightly\" caffeinated marketer would do: I spent my entire day building the thing myself. 🤣 Let’s just say PETTINESS is the mother of invention. ✅ Yes, I unsubscribed from the plugin. ✅ Yes, I saved us some money. But more than that? This tool saves me doubt. On a serious note, I’ve been working with two AI agents I trained over the past few months. A Content Writing Agent that crafts SEO-aligned, brand-consistent content and an SEO Optimization Agent that fine-tunes relevance, checks facts, and ensures strategic alignment. Still, every single post lands on my \"desk\" before it goes live. Because here’s what I’ve learned after working with AI systems for a few years now: AI can get you 80% of the way there. But the last 20%... the part where clarity, resonance, and trust live... That’s still human work. So when I see a post hit a 90+ SEO score in my own tool, I know it’s ready-- optimized, intentional, and aligned with our conversion strategy. Because I’m still human. And humans? We FEEL when something’s ready to publish. So no, I’m not a dev. I’m just a marketer who got tired of half-baked tools and decided to build my own. With AI as an assistant, I’m not just working faster... I’m working smarter, cheaper, and with more PEACE OF MIND. And if that means rolling up my sleeves to 🚀 my own SEO editor in a day? So be it. 😎 Petty? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely. P.S. I’m planning to open source this once I finish testing and pushing a few more updates. Will be making the GitHub repo public soon! For all the old-school content marketers out there who still need their trusty editors (this time at no extra cost)! 😉 #AI #NoCode #SEO #ClaudeAI #ChatGPTCodex #ContentMarketing #DigitalStrategy #MarketingTools #HumanInTheLoop #WorkSmarter #MarketingOps","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] From Zero to Frame by Frame > 💻 I used to edit videos in my bedroom with a cracked software license… 🌍 Now I edit for paying clients around the world. When I first started video editing, I didn’t have the right tools. No formal training. No connections. Just a slow laptop, a free YouTube tutorial, and an obsession with telling stories through moving frames. I remember staying up until 3AM trying to sync audio with dialogue — and failing miserably. But each time I hit “undo,” I learned something new. Every mistake sharpened my eye, steadying my hand for the next cut. I’d send videos to friends asking, “Does this look okay?” They’d say yes, even when it wasn’t. I kept going anyway. Then one day — someone paid me. Not much. But enough to realize: > This isn’t just a hobby. This is what I’m meant to do. Now I’ve had the privilege to work on projects that have made people cry, laugh, and remember what matters. Weddings. Startups. Personal brands. Music videos. Each one different — but each one built frame by frame with heart. 🎥 To anyone chasing a dream with nothing but passion and perseverance — keep going. You’re closer than you think. And if you need a video editor who understands the grind, the emotion, and the storytelling behind every clip — I’m here.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] HOW TO WIN EVERY BATTLE.. Everyone has their own struggles. But the worst thing is when your struggles show up in public. That's why we see so many people who are out of control. - They go through mental breakdowns. - They face visible health challenges. - They lack any kind of success. And it's all because they have refused to deal with their problems in a private manner. Here's the truth.. The difference between who you ARE RIGHT NOW and WHO YOU WANT TO BE is how well you handle everything behind the scenes. Why? Because it's easy to look good for a short period of time. But if you want success that lasts forever, then you must be willing and able to handle the long bouts of unprecedented adversity. It's the only way you'll really make it. That's why the more battles you win in private, the less you'll lose in public. I'll give you an example. When I was in high school, I failed several English classes. I failed many classes in college as well. Then I realized that I had the talent of writing, but I didn't know how to bring it all together. So l eventually wrote many articles. And I hired editors to go through my work. I have also journaled millions of words. After all the years of writing, you're finally reading this. By overcoming my private struggles, you are now able to enjoy my public success. So the next time you think about quitting, realize that what you do behind the scenes is what will result in your winning. Because winners never quit. And quitters never win. There's no limit to how far you can go. So continue to grind in private so your results can show! Type TRUE if you agree!👇🏽 - Daniel Ally","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Most indie makers completely misunderstand how to market their AI products. They demo features to cold audiences. And then wonder why nobody converts... After building VidMe and other AI tools, I've learned there are 5 levels of product awareness: 1. Problem Unaware They don't know they have a problem → Create content showing the pain point → \"Why manual video editing is killing your content strategy\" 2. Problem Aware They know the problem but not the solution → Educate on solution categories → \"3 ways to automate your video creation process\" 3. Solution Aware They know solutions exist but not YOUR product → Compare approaches and benefits → \"AI video generation vs hiring editors vs DIY\" 4. Product Aware They know your product but aren't convinced → Show proof and overcome objections → Case studies, demos, social proof 5. Most Aware They're ready to buy, just need the right offer → Clear CTA with urgency/value → \"Get started with VidMe today\" The key insight: Don't propose marriage on the first date. Meet your audience where they are in their awareness journey. I've made this mistake with every product launch. Now I map content to awareness levels first. Building in public means sharing real lessons from real products. What awareness level is your audience at?","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Marketing Managers need to hire people from TV! I spent 24 hours cutting this podcast trailer, and my fingers found their rhythm immediately. The years of trawling through Love Island clips, finding the perfect lines and cutting them together to make a sizzle have paid off! Suddenly I felt very grateful for those moments when my laptop was overheating and I was tempted to throw it off the Fremantle balcony to the street below. It also confirmed what I suspected all along - my skills are in fact transferable?! This is what marketing managers are missing - TV people are narrative experts. They understand pacing, tension, and how to hook an audience in seconds. I have been trained by mentors who live and breathe storytelling. Sure, they might not know what ROAS means (yet) and they probably haven't built an Instagram to thousands. But they can make your content incredibly watchable. There's an entire industry packed with storytellers looking to branch into new industries and new ways of making content. They've spent years making reality TV addictive. Imagine what they could do with your brand story. Next time you're hiring for editor/content creator/marketer, consider a candidate without direct marketing experience. The person who made Love Island compulsive viewing might be exactly what your content strategy needs. If you like the trailer, the full episode is even better - give it a watch! 😉","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Dear hiring managers and editors, We don’t expect magic. We don’t expect handholding. Most of us don’t even expect a yes. But if you’re asking freelancers to pitch or apply, please consider a few basics: - State the pay rate. “Competitive” isn’t a rate. Neither is “TBD.” - Say if the role is filled. Ghosting isn’t a communications strategy. - Don’t ask for unpaid trial tasks. If you want to see how we write, read what we’ve written! - Include a name. “Dear writer” makes us all feel worse. - Give realistic timelines. If you won’t decide for three months, say so. - Don’t advertise ‘ongoing work’ if it’s one article. - If the piece is killable, say how much of the fee is guaranteed. - Reply to accepted pitches before the news cycle moves on. Have a little clarity and human decency, and you'll find freelancers who want to work hard for you, go the extra mile, and keep working with you for the long haul. You might be surprised by just how much that means to us. Yours sincerely, Freelancers everywhere","label":0}
{"text":"[LINKEDIN] 🚨 Based on a true event 🚨 Recently, someone reached out to me for video editing services. It started off seriously — ❓ What software do you use? ❓ What are your PC specs? ❓ What’s your internet speed? Basically, a whole interview like they were hiring a #NASA editor. But when I asked about the budget... 💀 \"500 rupees per short video.\" Excuse me… WHAT!? I was genuinely stunned. In 2025, someone expects #high-quality edits using After Effects and Premiere Pro — tools that require skill, time, and powerful hardware — for the price of a street snack. Let’s not forget, I’ve spent 3 years mastering this craft. This isn't just clicking buttons — it’s storytelling, color theory, transitions, keyframing, sound design — the whole cinematic experience. And yes, 9 out of 10 times, it's always someone from #Pakistan or #India on platforms like #Upwork or #Fiverr who thinks #editing is just dragging and dropping clips. They don’t value creativity or the time and talent that goes into this work. It’s sad, really. 🧠 To all #freelancers out there: Know your worth. Set your rates. And say \"NO\" to exploitation.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] There's a new world order for how to compete in business, and I did a 27 min pod on how we got here/where we're going and what that means for media and marketing. If you're curious but have no time to listen, here's the gist: In 2021, 0% interest rates made companies flush with cash, which made google/facebook ads oversaturated, which made brand building important again. Around the same time, HubSpot's founder Dharmesh Shah decided it was a good time to buy The Hustle and launch a full on media company for business builders. Brands had been toying around with hiring journalists/building media for years, but a mix of a) necessity to move beyond demand gen as it became less efficient, and b) the company that literally coined the term \"Inbound\" tripling down on media, both acted as catalysts. The past five years, hundreds of brands have hired managing editors, economists, etc, to put out authority building content. To exacerbate things, launching a company is now easier than ever. AI has made it so english majors can build software. And in a world where it's harder to differentiate on product.... distribution separates the winners from the losers. In 2025 (and beyond), you must compete on brand. That is why brands are hiring journalists in droves and launching media arms. That is why I am posting on LinkedIn. It's a new world order, and I had a hell of a time talking with Jeff Barrett about it. Or you can listen to full pod here: https://lnkd.in/e_GFPEaH","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Day 36 #0to30DhumiAI to #30to100DhumiAI 🎬 “One blog post. Ten videos. Zero editing headaches.” 🚀 Here’s a small truth about content — most brands write way more than they show. We were guilty too. Blogs? Dozens of them. Great info, solid keywords — but once published, they’d just sit there gathering digital dust. No reels. No snackable video clips. No life beyond the page. Hiring a video editor for every little blog? Didn’t make sense. Trying to do it ourselves? Way too clunky. Then we found Lumen5 — an underrated gem for turning text into scroll-stopping videos in minutes. All we do now is drop a blog link or paste in our text → Lumen5’s AI picks out key phrases, matches it with stock clips and music → boom, we’ve got a shareable video for LinkedIn, Insta, or email campaigns. No learning Premiere Pro. No briefing freelancers. No overthinking visuals or music rights. One of our blogs about AI dashboards? We turned it into ten short videos last month — each one driving way more views than the original article ever did. So now, instead of pushing a post once and moving on, we stretch it. One piece → multiple formats → fresh reach, new eyeballs. It’s not fancy Hollywood magic. It’s practical AI doing what we don’t have time for. Quiet ROI nobody sees — but the numbers speak. #DhumiAI #0to30DhumiAI #Lumen5 #ContentRepurposing #AIForMarketing #WorkSmarter","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Read this if you're a company that wants to have a successful YouTube brand channel. These 5 harsh truths that will increase your chances of succeeding. - First off.. Leave your ego at the door. I don't care if you've worked at Apple, or Google, or if you've been a traditional marketer for 20 years. YouTube is a different beast. It's completely different from every other platform. Let the specialists do their job, don't micro-manage, and be willing to learn. - Hire editors who have experience with YouTube, not who come from mainstream backgrounds. It's a completely different skillset. - Hire thumbnail designers who know how to make a good YouTube thumbnail, not a graphic designer who has been 'traditionally' trained. - Hire a YouTube specialist to develop your strategy. Ideation, packaging, editing style, and retention strategy. Not a 'social media manager' who has little specialized experience with the platform. - Build your brand with your content, not your thumbnails. They're not their to be artsy, they're there to get clicks.","label":0}
{"text":"[LINKEDIN] The Art of Professional Video Editing: Clean Cuts, Seamless Transitions, and the Power of Remote Work In today’s fast-paced digital world, high-quality video content is essential for businesses to stand out. But what separates an amateur edit from a polished, professional corporate video? The answer lies in precision, storytelling, and seamless transitions—not flashy effects that distract from the message. What Does Professional Video Editing Look Like? A well-edited corporate video should: ✅ Focus on clarity – Smooth cuts that maintain flow without confusing the viewer. ✅ Use subtle transitions – Cross dissolves, dip-to-black, or match cuts that feel natural, not dizzying. ✅ Maintain consistent pacing – Keeping engagement high without rushing or dragging scenes. ✅ Enhance storytelling – Every cut should serve the narrative, not just showcase editing skills. ✅ Prioritize audio quality – Clean voiceovers, balanced music, and crisp sound design. Overly flashy transitions (like spins, glitches, or excessive zoom effects) can make a corporate video feel unprofessional. Instead, smooth, purposeful edits build trust and keep the focus on the content. The Benefits of Hiring a Remote Video Editor Many businesses hesitate to outsource video editing, but working with a skilled remote editor offers major advantages: 🌍 Access to top talent – No geographical limits means you can hire the best editors worldwide. 💰 Cost-effective – No need for in-house staff or expensive equipment—just pay for the final product. ⏱ Faster turnaround – Professional editors work efficiently, delivering high-quality edits on schedule. 📈 Scalability – Easily scale up video production without hiring full-time employees. 🔄 Flexible collaboration – Cloud-based tools (Frame.io, Dropbox, Google Drive) make feedback and revisions seamless. Whether it’s a company promo, training video, or social media ad, a professionally edited video elevates your brand—without unnecessary distractions. Final Thoughts Great editing is invisible. It guides the viewer effortlessly through the story, reinforcing your message rather than overshadowing it. And with remote video editors, businesses can achieve high-quality results efficiently and cost-effectively. Need a professionally edited corporate video?

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Google Veo 3 in Poland – a new era of video creation with the help of artificial intelligence Google Veo 3 – artificial intelligence creating videos with sound now in Poland! 🚀 I find that few things in the marketing industry can surprise me today, but the debut of Veo 3 from Google really brought a smile. The new model can not only generate a video from just text but also add super realistic sound: voices, effects, background noise – all synchronized. Sounds like fun from the future? For content creators and marketers, it's not a joke but a tool I actually use daily. What does Veo 3 offer? - A video ready to upload to social media or use in presentations is created from a text prompt – no crews, graphic designers, or editors needed. - It intelligently understands even complex commands, preserves characters, styles, and fluidity of the image. - Allows combining short clips into larger sequences (Flow module) – super convenient for courses or mini marketing series. - Enables full integration with Gemini, Slides, or even make.com, n8n – automation at your fingertips. I personally tested Veo 3, among other things, for quick client presentations and safety training animations – I reduced the waiting time from weeks to hours, and clients smiled broadly. Sure – it won't replace the intuition of a human director yet, but imagine how much energy you'll save on simple, repetitive productions! See the potential? Veo 3 will open up a world where every marketer, business owner, or educator can create clips on their own terms. More examples, ready prompts, and tips can be found in my article on the blog – I invite you: In Polish: https://lnkd.in/dwpNmci2 In English: https://lnkd.in/dv52DN6q #AIMarketingMasters #B2BMarketingAutomation #MarketingEkspercki #DariuszCiesielski Źródło: https://lnkd.in/durqXXzD","label":0}

Sometimes you just have to let go of the story.” Deliver the best copy you can. Blow a deadline if what you have is truly subpar.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] I'm thrilled to announce that this is my first week as Editorial Director-at-Large at Lerner Publishing Group! I'll be shaping the list for Kar-Ben, Lerner's imprint specializing in Jewish picture books. To answer three questions you might about my new role: Q: \"What are you acquiring and how can I submit to you?\" A: I don't know yet! I'm starting by familiarizing myself with Kar-Ben's existing list and working on the books already signed up. I know I'll be looking for Jewish children's books, mostly picture books, with the occasional board book and short MG. That's as far as I've gotten. Once I have a better sense of the direction we want to take the list, I'll have much more to say on this matter. So stay tuned! Q: \"Are you shutting down The Book Engineer?\" A: Nope! Because I'm Editorial Director *at large*, I'm still keeping room in my schedule for other editing, writing, and book packaging. I like this setup because it means I don't need to part ways with my wonderful existing clients, and it means that I can work on a broader range of books (even those that aren't relevant to Kar-Ben's mission). If you've been around my LinkedIn page for a while, you know how interested I am in helping consumer-facing brands share their stories and connect with their audiences through books, and that remains a priority of the Book Engineer. Q: \"How did you get this job?\" A: This is something I always wonder when I see other people post job announcements, so I figured you might be wondering, too. Here's the story: Four years ago, a Lerner editor needed someone to babysit her books while she was on leave. My old boss recommended me for the gig. I shepherded the editor's books while she was out, and then, when she returned to work, she asked me to freelance edit another couple books in the next season. She has a fantastic list, so of course I said yes. She asked me the same question for the following season, and the season after. I've now edited a total of 25 books for Lerner. So when another Lerner imprint, Kar-Ben, needed an editorial director, I was someone whom they thought of because they were already working with me. It's an incredible opportunity. Without patting myself on the back overly much, I'm going to say that I think the moral of the story is: Sometimes, if you do good work, people will want to work with you.","label":0}
{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Malini Devadas has been editing for 21 years and freelancing for 12 and in that time, the world has changed so much. There are more and more editors coming into the marketplace every day, social media is not as easy to use for marketing as it used to be, and the rise of AI means that some writers think that they can bypass using a human editor altogether. On top of that, the cost of living is ever-increasing, so while editors need to charge more to earn a living, clients may not have the budgets that they once had. But it's not all doom and gloom! Once you understand how much money you need to charge (hint, it's probably more than you realise!), who your clients are and the problem that you solve for them, you can create a realistic marketing plan that you can actually implement.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] The first time we moved to Asia with our 2 young kids, we had a 7 hour layover in China. The airline offered hotel vouchers due to the long layover, and not wanting to be with a 3 and 1 year old in a Chinese airport for that long (okay any airport, but also their little blonde heads were attracting a lot of picture-taking), we took them up on it. We figured it would be like most airports here, with a hotel attached to the airport or down the road. So we followed instructions to get a cab, and figured it would be pretty close. Turns out it was a 15 minute drive through the city. In hindsight, this could have been super sketch, so thanks God for protecting us in our naivety. Anyway, we were pretty pumped because we can now say we’ve been to China, which no self respecting traveler would say if they only flew into the airport, and soon, arrived at our hotel. Power was out when we arrived. Literally checked-in speaking through Google Translate. Someone had slipped a business card into the room under the door, a woman who wished to do business in the hotel room (strange place to run a business, right? Wonder what industry she was in! 🫠). But whatever, we weren’t being kidnapped and we were actually in China. AND we had a bed and room to nap in. I plopped onto the bed and BANG. It was like landing on concrete. The smack reverberated up my spine and rattled my teeth. What even is this place?! So much for sleep. Too busy wondering, laughing, having a back ache. We went out for a walk and tried to buy a water. It turned out to be a clear pop of some kind. Gross. But cool, we engaged with the local economy. We decided we were already deep into having an adventure, and went to the dingy hotel cafeteria. Exactly the same as a Best Western breakfast spread but noodles instead of anything else, and it wasn’t the same at all. We somehow got the hotel to call us a cab and made it back to the airport so we could catch our next flight to Bangkok. Very unexpected but fitting way to start a 2 year period of travel and living in Thailand and Bulgaria! What’s the point? Mostly it’s a reminder to myself that the most interesting parts of life, family, business, adventure start with a wild, unusual decision. Something that most people would go “lol are you crazy” (heard this often). A decision and conviction that this path is TOTALLY out of your comfort level and mostly out of your control, but that the payoff is going to be exponentially bigger and better than doing what everyone expects you to do. Our married life is defined by many of these decisions and it’s so much more fun, rewarding, and packed with forced-growth! Same with the podcast I started out of FOMO a few years ago that led to closing $200k in the first 9 months of my group coaching program. Sorry LI, gotta balance personal stories and “btw if you need help launching or editing your podcast I know a guy” (it’s me). Thanks for reading!","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] 🚨 DEATH OF THE CODE EDITOR 🚨 I'm calling it. Writing software used to mean living in your code editor.... Fixing bugs by copy-and-pasting from Google an Stack Overflow. Then came ChatGPT – still copy-paste, but at least the robot wrote the draft. Github Copilot followed: an editor extension which was AI autocomplete on steroids. Editors like Cursor then took a massive lead - full AI-enabled code editors that reads your whole repo, adds files, writes tests. Then in-editor background agents allowed AI to multi-task... No more waiting 3 minutes for a response - we could spawn 10 agentic AI workers in our editor, running parallel tasks and us acting as the conductor of the symphony. But I believe the code editor is short-lived. And this pains me, as editors mean a lot to developers. (I still love Sublime Text, the first code editor I fell in love with). 🤖 Cursor just unleashed autonomous AI agents on the web + mobile. This means from a web app, your phone, a Slack message, or soon to be any number of communication channels, you can send an autonomous AI agent to work. Writing your code, fixing your bugs, doing a deep-dive investigation - no code editor required. Tools like Devin took the lead with this - but I think we are about to see it go mainstream. I believe this is a reason why all the big AI labs have released command line AI coding tools - OpenAI's Codex, Claude Code, and now Gemini CLI. Unlike fully fledged GUI code editors, command line programs can *easly* be used in a headless environment, meaning an environment where it might not be a human interacting with the command line - but another AI. I believe this is the start of a bigger shift: if AI can read, write and refactor code without an IDE, the bottleneck isn’t coding – it’s telling the AI exactly what to build. My guess? The new “coding will be crystal-clear requirements that every human can read and every AI agent can execute. The future will be... interesting. Thoughts? Come at me.","label":0}
{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Netflix has just patented a new method for extracting the most compelling moments from shows and movies to create trailers and clips with no human editor required. The goal? Better recommendations, more clicks, and more watch time. The system builds trailers and previews based on things like which characters appear on screen or how scenes are sequenced. Clip curation is labor-intensive, and it could be biased. (Don’t like the lead actor? You might skip their best scene.) Netflix says automation solves that, helping them scale content discovery across their massive library. It’s part of a bigger push to improve how we find shows: new home screens, vertical video feeds, even Emmy-award badges to help titles stand out. #Netflix #StreamingTech #AI #MarketingInnovation #ContentDiscovery","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] 2025 SEO Trends You Can’t Afford to Ignore If you're planning to use the same old SEO tactics in 2025, you’re already behind. Search is evolving fast—and so are Google’s expectations. Here are the essential trends shaping SEO in 2025 that you cannot afford to ignore: ✅ 1. AI Content Needs Human Editing Everyone’s using AI to churn out content. But Google can detect low-quality, generic AI text—and it’s cracking down. Winning strategy: Use AI for speed and ideation. Always human-edit for tone, clarity, and authority. 2025 SEO = Hybrid content workflows. ✅ 2. Search is Omnichannel Now SEO isn’t just about Google anymore. Your customers search on: TikTok (how-tos, trends) YouTube (reviews, demos) Reddit (real discussions) Amazon (buying intent) Brands must optimize for all discovery channels. “If you're only ranking on Google, you're missing half your audience.” ✅ 3. Zero-Click SERPs Are the New Normal Google’s SERPs are flooded with featured snippets, AI overviews, and instant answers. Users get what they need without clicking. 2025 priority: Optimize for visibility in these snippets. Focus on brand presence, not just traffic. ✅ 4. Topic Clusters Outperform Random Posts Google prefers structured authority over content spam. Key approach: Build content hubs with interlinked, in-depth articles. Demonstrate topic expertise at scale. Clusters = Authority. ✅ 5. E-E-A-T is Non-Negotiable Google is doubling down on Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust. To rank in 2025, your content needs: Real author bios and credentials. Verified expertise. Transparent trust signals. Generic, anonymous writing gets buried. ✅ 6. User Experience is a Ranking Factor Google’s ranking systems now heavily factor: Load times (under 2 seconds). Accessibility. Mobile-first design. Clean, engaging layouts. “Good UX isn’t optional—it’s SEO.” ✅ 7. Link Building is About Relationships Low-quality link exchanges are obsolete. 2025 SEO link strategy: Partnerships. Co-marketing. Genuine thought leadership. Natural citations. Google values trust signals, not tricks. ✅ 8. SGE and Structured Data Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) is mainstream in 2025. Smart brands: Use structured data and schema. Make content easy for AI overviews to digest. Optimize for FAQs, how-tos, and clear sections. ⚡ Final Thought SEO in 2025 isn’t about chasing algorithms—it’s about genuinely serving your audience wherever they search. If you’re not adapting to these trends, you’re not just falling behind—you’re disappearing. ✅ Which of these trends are you already working on?

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] A few days ago, I learned a hard but valuable lesson as a freelance video editor. I was approached by a US recruiter on LinkedIn for what seemed like a great opportunity, a full-time video editing role for a YouTube channel. At first I was unsure whether to proceed or not, but when I saw that most of the people in my network follow The said recruiter, I thought, why not give it a try? I was excited, motivated, and ready to bring my best. I was asked to do a test task, which I invested a lot of time, effort, and research into. I submitted the project and then… nothing. No response. No feedback. Complete silence. I’ll be honest, it hurt. I felt used, discouraged, and for a moment, I even questioned myself. But here’s what I realized: ✅ Always clarify if a test task is paid. ✅ Protect your work watermark or send a lower-resolution version. ✅ If a client or recruiter disappears after receiving your work, it says more about them than it does about you. ✅ Use every project, even the unpaid ones, to sharpen your skills and build your portfolio.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Dear companies, Can we stop pretending internships are only for college students? Sincerely, A postgrad girl with ambitions, three degrees, and zero internship openings to apply for. Look, job hunting already feels like trying to survive Miranda Priestly’s office with no fashion sense, no connections, and no clue what cerulean is—but the pressure? Still sky-high. Then add in the whole “entry-level but must have 3 years of experience” thing, and suddenly I’m not even qualified to apply. How exactly am I supposed to get experience if all the doors are locked and I don’t have the secret student key anymore? Not all of us knew our dream job at 18. Some of us took a little while longer to get there—and that should be okay! I’m not asking for handouts. I’m asking for a fair shot.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Just finished scraping 1243 freelance video editing job posts across Reddit, LinkedIn, and Twitter—and running them all through ChatGPT for analysis. The insights completely flipped how I look at the freelance video editing world. Biggest surprise: Motion Graphics rules the game. I assumed tools like After Effects or Premiere would dominate job descriptions, but the term “Motion Graphics” popped up way more often than anything else. Clients clearly crave dynamic, animated content far beyond standard cutting and editing. Some other things that stood out: Mondays are hot for job posts. There were 80% more listings on Mondays than Sundays. So if you’re applying, timing could be everything. Color grading isn’t in demand like you’d think. Despite being a premium skill, barely anyone specifically requests it in job posts. I’m planning to dig deeper into this data—maybe explore how rates vary by skill or platform next.","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] 5 years ago, when I was 12, I got fascinated by video editing. While most kids played outside, I was learning how to edit videos using just my phone and YouTube. I shared my video editing work in a group. Someone reached out. I didn’t have a laptop, so I offered to work in exchange for one. He agreed and that one laptop opened a new world for me. After some time, I felt video editing wasn’t for me. So I kept exploring and that’s when I discovered copywriting. My first copy looked like a whole novel 😅 But I kept learning, practicing and improving. Over time, I started working with clients across the US, UK, France and more. People often told me: “Just focus on studies.” But I always believed in learning skills alongside education. I’m still a student. - Still learning. - Still building. - Still working on my dreams.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] 🎬 5 Client Red Flags That Slow Down Video Projects Smooth collaboration is the backbone of a successful video editing project. But when certain client behaviours go unchecked, they can derail timelines, drain creative energy, and lead to frustration on both ends. Here are five common client red flags that slow down video projects—plus how editors can handle them like pros. 1. Vague or Incomplete Project Briefs When a client sends over a vague brief (or none at all), you're left guessing about the vision, tone, style, and deliverables. This leads to unnecessary back-and-forth, misaligned edits, and wasted time. ✓ Use a project brief template to collect clear objectives, references, deadlines, and platforms ✓ Ask direct questions to fill gaps early ✓ Don’t begin until the brief is agreed upon Pro Tip: No clarity = no efficiency. Always secure a strong foundation first. 2. Scope Creep & Endless Revisions Some clients keep adding tasks or asking for “one more tiny edit” long after the scope is set. Without boundaries, this eats into time and profit, and derails your editing queue. ✓ Set clear revision limits in your proposal or contract ✓ Communicate what's included vs. chargeable extras ✓ Gently redirect when new tasks arise unexpectedly Pro Tip: Stick to the agreed scope. Free rein = no finish line. 3. Unrealistic Deadlines & Rush Requests When clients want high-quality videos in 24 hours, they often don’t grasp the editing process. Rushing can compromise quality and create stress—for both parties. ✓ Educate clients on realistic timelines based on the project type ✓ Suggest better alternatives if the deadline is too tight ✓ Say no to projects that compromise your standards Pro Tip: Fast, good, or cheap—pick two. Don’t sacrifice your process for pressure. 4. Poor Communication & Delayed Feedback Delayed replies or vague feedback like “make it pop” can bring your progress to a halt. Lack of timely approvals means stalled timelines and bottlenecks. ✓ Set communication expectations early—how often, through what platform, and by when ✓ Use tools like Frame.io, Notion, or timestamped comments for clarity ✓ Pause work if feedback is repeatedly delayed Pro Tip: Your timeline is only as efficient as their feedback loop. 5. Undervaluing Your Time & Effort Some clients expect premium edits for bottom-dollar rates or “exposure.” Others want unlimited revisions at no extra cost. This devalues your skills and leads to burnout. ✓ Be transparent about pricing, revision policies, and what’s included ✓ Don’t negotiate against your own worth ✓ Walk away if respect isn’t mutual Pro Tip: Value your work—because clients model their respect off how you set boundaries. 🎯 Final Thoughts The best video projects come from mutual respect and clear communication. Spotting red flags early and setting boundaries protects your time, creativity, and peace of mind. Communicate clearly. Set expectations early. Protect your process.","label":0}

But here’s what actually works (and what we now teach editors in our coaching program):👇 ⸻ ✅ 1. Niche Portfolio > Random Work Don’t just show off “cool edits.” Build a portfolio around one niche – like: • YouTube channels • Podcasts • Real estate • Influencers • E-learning creators 🎯 Specialists get hired. Generalists get ignored. ⸻ ✅ 2. LinkedIn is Your Secret Weapon Most editors ignore it. That’s a mistake. Here’s what we help our students do: → Write a killer headline & bio → Add a “Featured” section with your best work → Get real endorsements → Use niche-specific keywords to get discovered by recruiters ⸻ ✅ 3. Speak Like a Pro (Even if You’re a Beginner) It’s not just “Can you edit?” It’s → “Can you explain your value clearly in interviews and DMs?” We help editors master job-winning communication that makes recruiters listen. ⸻ ✅ 4. Our 4-Week Job-Getting System Yes, it’s possible to get paid ₹15K–₹35K/month (without a fancy degree or big client list).

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] It’s reported that Paramount has agreed to pay USD16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump over the “60 Minutes” interview with then–Vice President Kamala Harris. The timing is notable, as Paramount seeks approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission for its USD8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media. Some U.S. senators have accused Paramount of offering a quid pro quo to facilitate the merger. I don’t have the legal expertise and am not in a position to assess this claim—but from a PR standpoint, this case is a rather bizarre one. The incident originated during Harris’s presidential campaign against Trump. In a CBS “60 Minutes” interview, she was asked about the Israel–Hamas war. Her “word salad” response—a meandering 179-word “word salad”—was later edited down to just 20 words, presumably to make her appear more coherent. Trump then sued the network, alleging election interference. From a communications management perspective, several missteps stand out: It seems CBS has been friendly to Harris’s camp. Her team should have been alerted of the interview topics in advance and rehearsed answers accordingly. Why didn’t they? The interview was pre-recorded, not live. If her response to the Israel question was deemed unsatisfactory, there was ample opportunity to re-record. Why didn’t anyone—Harris, her team, or the producer—flag this in the moment? Strangely, only during post-production did the editor decide to “fix” it. Harris reportedly spent over USD1 billion on her campaign—a high-stakes endeavor in the most pivotal chapter of her political career. Yet, despite such immense resources, even the most fundamental aspects of media handling appear to have been overlooked. As someone who has worked in strategic communications for four decades, I find this genuinely surprising. #trump #kamalaharris #CBS #Paramount #60minutes","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] We are currently looking for an Editor for the Mackintosh Society Journal. This is a Freelance Role - Honorarium. A 32 page A4 magazine published annually in late April/early May before the June AGM. Sent to all Society members – c700 in UK, Europe, America, E Asia, Australasia. Individual copies available for sale in the CRM Shop at the Society HQ, Mackintosh Queen’s Cross, 870 Garscube Road, Glasgow G20 7EL. Digital or part digital publication under consideration but would not affect editorial role. Do you seek a freelance art world editorial role? If so, this could be an opportunity for you. The C R Mackintosh Society, a registered charity and a leading heritage organisation in Glasgow, celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2023. You would be working with architecture and applied art in Glasgow and beyond, primarily around 1900, specifically in relation to C R Mackintosh and his circle. You need sensitivity to language and style, attention to detail to ensure consistency and accuracy and an ability to work to deadlines. Authors and content are identified, deadlines specified, house style guidance determined, and all contributors briefed during the autumn. The Editor’s intensive work in the January to March period lies in the preparation of the content, edited with the support of the sub-committee members, for the designer. Keeping to this timetable is vital. The Journal’s readership is seriously interested but non-academic and all contributors are encouraged to write accessibly with a minimum of academic jargon and footnotes. Content includes short articles, reviews, interviews, reports on buildings, campaigns and Society activities. The Society has its own image bank, but contributors are responsible for sourcing other hi-res images and clearing copyright. Software used: Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, We Transfer/Dropbox for high-res image transfer. The Editor works with the support of the Society Council’s Publications Sub-Committee [PubSub] (3 or 4 members of the Society’s Council and staff with Editor if available) which meets about 3 times a year at the Mackintosh Church – September, February and April. They provide, invite and select content, supply author contact details and review and update house style guidance in conjunction with the Editor. They assist as readers and sub-editors. The PubSub Chair reports to the Society’s Council. A freelance designer working to the established design template prepares the final layout, texts and images collated by the Editor. The Journal final layout and content is given clearance to go to press in April, having satisfied the Editor, PubSub Chair, Society Chair and Director, and distributed to members and contributors in late April/early May.

I’m so glad that my author client, Ann-Elizabeth Briars, entrusted the editing of her wonderful Stars of Time trilogy to me. She is a talented writer who deserves to go far, and I can’t wait to see what she produces next! “Working with Debbie was one of the best decisions I’ve made as an author. She edited my trilogy with the utmost professionalism, care, and dedication. “She was thorough and detail-oriented, and went above and beyond the role of editor—offering thoughtful insights, story advice, and encouragement. I learned so much from working with her. “She was always friendly, approachable, and genuinely invested in helping my books reach their full potential. “I highly recommend Debbie to any author looking for a trusted editor and a true creative partner.” —Ann-Elizabeth Briars, Stars of Time trilogy #editing #WritingCommunity #FictionWriters","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Apparently I’m a Descript 'Power User'. Maybe I need to add this as a service? I work across various audio and video editors - Hindenburg - Final Cut - Descript - Riverside - Veed - Audition I started using Descript out of curiosity. A new tool in my industry. I pushed myself to push it. At times I broke it. At others, it broke me. Turns out just wanting to make decent looking and sounding video and podcasts and promos, has made me one of their 'most advanced' users. And it's not even my most used editing tool. I don't use it to edit full episodes (though I have tried it, and with a lot of finessing it is possible). I get that it can be awkward to get your head around. Just relying on their quick AI edit features can actually make your podcast or video sound a bit clunky. But with a human involved, it can be really good. So - Maybe people are looking for Descript editors? Or maybe people would like help teaching them how to use Descript better? If I’ve morphed into a mighty “Power User”. I should probably use my powers for good. --- 👋 I'm Steve and despite the unimpressed look of my cockapoo sidekick, let me be the saviour of your video podcasts and podcast edits.","label":0}

Here’s what I think is happening: * They’re not looking to hire. * They’re looking to farm reach. * The more people comment, the more LinkedIn boosts the post. It’s a free engagement, fake hiring urgency.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Here it comes. This is one of the first job postings I've seen where a news organization is actively promoting and seeking an editor who is expected to use AI in their daily workflow (and I'm probably late to the party).

AI Sports Editor at USA TODAY: https://lnkd.in/g4eeGPVq When I talk to friends outside the publishing world, they assume AI is still 5 to 10 years away from impacting them. But it's not. Generative AI is here to stay, and it's already at your workplace. But it doesn't have to be a scary thing! Use it, get familiar with it. Test what it can and can't do, both at work and in your personal life. Ask it to rewrite an email. Give it the remaining five ingredients in your pantry and have it create a recipe. Use it to do a research deep-dive. And for my fellow journalists: Start brushing up on your tech skills. We're going to need it.","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Traditionally, we’ve been taught that filmmaking begins with Development — the birth of the idea, the script, the hustle for funding. Then comes Preproduction — casting, crew, location scouting. Production follows, with its lights, cameras, wahala, and beautiful chaos. Post-production gives us editors who fix what our ancestors couldn't save on set.😂 Then, of course, we enter Marketing, Exhibition, and Distribution — the glitz, the campaigns, the premieres, the pirated copies on Telegram, before the film even drops. But what if I told you there’s a sixth stage? One nobody talks about. One we neglect to our own cultural peril. Let’s call it: Archiving. Yes. We can actually make Archiving the Sixth Stage of Production. You see, filmmaking isn’t just about stories — it’s about memory. It’s about time-travel. It’s about telling our unborn children, “This is who we were. This is what we felt. This is what we survived.” But in Nigeria, we produce like people with no past. Or worse — people with no future. We wrap the film, pop champagne, post a few BTS reels, and throw hard drives into drawers like they’re Chin-Chin packs. Five years later, the files are corrupted, the masters are lost, and the filmmaker is begging an editor to \"just export anything, abeg.\"😭 Imagine if Archeologist treated artifacts the way filmmakers treat dailies. Imagine if surgeons left surgeries undocumented. Imagine if musicians lost the stems of their greatest hits. No Beyoncé remix. No Fela remaster. No 2Baba reissue. We must treat Archiving not as an afterthought, but as a stage of production in its own right — budgeted for, planned for, and taken seriously. In Hollywood, George Lucas didn't just shoot Star Wars. He archived everything — from raw footage to costume designs to early drafts. That’s why decades later, the franchise keeps giving. It’s a galaxy far, far away, but deeply rooted in careful documentation. In architecture, blueprints are archived. In medicine, patient records are sacrosanct. In law, transcripts are gold. In the culinary arts, grandma’s recipe must be preserved — or Jollof is lost to bad data. So why not in filmmaking? Archiving means: Proper metadata and documentation. Backups stored in cloud and physical drives. Scripts, BTS footage, call sheets, and posters preserved. Formats exported for future platforms — think ahead to Web4 or holo-screens. Deposits made to national archives or trusted institutions. It’s how your work outlives your IG page. And let’s not pretend this is foreign. In our oral traditions, griots were living archives. Every masquerade, every dance, every story by moonlight was archived in memory and performance. Technology is just a continuation of that spirit. So, the next time you call wrap on set, remember: you haven’t finished until you’ve archived. Archiving shouldn't be a luxury. It is legacy. So, let's what? Archive! Ogoo, #Jos.","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] How do I deal with anxiety when recording video's? I've been playing around with the idea of creating a YouTube channel for a while. It would be primarily retro/homebrew game development tutorials and devlogs. It's a genre where a facecam isn't really expected, or even all that common, so the video's would basically just be footage of the game engine or IDE, with a voice over. But here's the problem... I have pretty poor communication and presentation skills, which are mostly a result of anxiety, and just being generally introverted. English isn't my first language, so that's an additional hurdle when trying to record a video. My pronunciation isn't that bad, and I don't mind having a bit of an accent, but it takes just a little more effort to speak fluently. Especially when trying to \"freestyle\" a video. I also live in an apartment where the walls are super thin (I can literally hear my neighbours fart), so I'm generally tempted to keep my voice down. I've tried recording a video a while ago, but after re-recording the same lines 20 times, I ended up getting voice-over fatigue, and took a break, telling myself \"I'll just finish it tomorrow\". Never ended up finishing it. Does anyone have any tips on how deal with this, and to motivate myself to just go for it? I'm not interested in using any kind of text-to-speech or AI voice software, by the way. This is something I'm actively trying to improve, so I don't want to take any shortcuts.","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] I just built this custom visual SEO editor from scratch. ❌ No advanced coding background. ❌ No dev team. ❌ No pre-made plugin. Just Claude + ChatGPT Codex + VSCode... and 8 focused hours. Here’s why: The SEO plugin we were using suddenly wanted us to upgrade just to access the “advanced features.” And I was like… what the heck?! We’re already paying and now you want us to pay more??? So, I did what any reasonable, non-technical, \"slightly\" caffeinated marketer would do: I spent my entire day building the thing myself. 🤣 Let’s just say PETTINESS is the mother of invention. ✅ Yes, I unsubscribed from the plugin. ✅ Yes, I saved us some money. But more than that? This tool saves me doubt. On a serious note, I’ve been working with two AI agents I trained over the past few months. A Content Writing Agent that crafts SEO-aligned, brand-consistent content and an SEO Optimization Agent that fine-tunes relevance, checks facts, and ensures strategic alignment. Still, every single post lands on my \"desk\" before it goes live. Because here’s what I’ve learned after working with AI systems for a few years now: AI can get you 80% of the way there. But the last 20%... the part where clarity, resonance, and trust live... That’s still human work. So when I see a post hit a 90+ SEO score in my own tool, I know it’s ready-- optimized, intentional, and aligned with our conversion strategy. Because I’m still human. And humans? We FEEL when something’s ready to publish. So no, I’m not a dev. I’m just a marketer who got tired of half-baked tools and decided to build my own. With AI as an assistant, I’m not just working faster... I’m working smarter, cheaper, and with more PEACE OF MIND. And if that means rolling up my sleeves to 🚀 my own SEO editor in a day? So be it. 😎 Petty? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely. P.S. I’m planning to open source this once I finish testing and pushing a few more updates. Will be making the GitHub repo public soon! For all the old-school content marketers out there who still need their trusty editors (this time at no extra cost)! 😉 #AI #NoCode #SEO #ClaudeAI #ChatGPTCodex #ContentMarketing #DigitalStrategy #MarketingTools #HumanInTheLoop #WorkSmarter #MarketingOps","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] From Zero to Frame by Frame > 💻 I used to edit videos in my bedroom with a cracked software license… 🌍 Now I edit for paying clients around the world. When I first started video editing, I didn’t have the right tools. No formal training. No connections. Just a slow laptop, a free YouTube tutorial, and an obsession with telling stories through moving frames. I remember staying up until 3AM trying to sync audio with dialogue — and failing miserably. But each time I hit “undo,” I learned something new. Every mistake sharpened my eye, steadying my hand for the next cut. I’d send videos to friends asking, “Does this look okay?” They’d say yes, even when it wasn’t. I kept going anyway. Then one day — someone paid me. Not much. But enough to realize: > This isn’t just a hobby. This is what I’m meant to do. Now I’ve had the privilege to work on projects that have made people cry, laugh, and remember what matters. Weddings. Startups. Personal brands. Music videos. Each one different — but each one built frame by frame with heart. 🎥 To anyone chasing a dream with nothing but passion and perseverance — keep going. You’re closer than you think. And if you need a video editor who understands the grind, the emotion, and the storytelling behind every clip — I’m here.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] HOW TO WIN EVERY BATTLE.. Everyone has their own struggles. But the worst thing is when your struggles show up in public. That's why we see so many people who are out of control. - They go through mental breakdowns. - They face visible health challenges. - They lack any kind of success. And it's all because they have refused to deal with their problems in a private manner. Here's the truth.. The difference between who you ARE RIGHT NOW and WHO YOU WANT TO BE is how well you handle everything behind the scenes. Why? Because it's easy to look good for a short period of time. But if you want success that lasts forever, then you must be willing and able to handle the long bouts of unprecedented adversity. It's the only way you'll really make it. That's why the more battles you win in private, the less you'll lose in public. I'll give you an example. When I was in high school, I failed several English classes. I failed many classes in college as well. Then I realized that I had the talent of writing, but I didn't know how to bring it all together. So l eventually wrote many articles. And I hired editors to go through my work. I have also journaled millions of words. After all the years of writing, you're finally reading this. By overcoming my private struggles, you are now able to enjoy my public success. So the next time you think about quitting, realize that what you do behind the scenes is what will result in your winning. Because winners never quit. And quitters never win. There's no limit to how far you can go. So continue to grind in private so your results can show! Type TRUE if you agree!👇🏽 - Daniel Ally","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Most indie makers completely misunderstand how to market their AI products. They demo features to cold audiences. And then wonder why nobody converts... After building VidMe and other AI tools, I've learned there are 5 levels of product awareness: 1. Problem Unaware They don't know they have a problem → Create content showing the pain point → \"Why manual video editing is killing your content strategy\" 2. Problem Aware They know the problem but not the solution → Educate on solution categories → \"3 ways to automate your video creation process\" 3. Solution Aware They know solutions exist but not YOUR product → Compare approaches and benefits → \"AI video generation vs hiring editors vs DIY\" 4. Product Aware They know your product but aren't convinced → Show proof and overcome objections → Case studies, demos, social proof 5. Most Aware They're ready to buy, just need the right offer → Clear CTA with urgency/value → \"Get started with VidMe today\" The key insight: Don't propose marriage on the first date. Meet your audience where they are in their awareness journey. I've made this mistake with every product launch. Now I map content to awareness levels first. Building in public means sharing real lessons from real products. What awareness level is your audience at?","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Marketing Managers need to hire people from TV! I spent 24 hours cutting this podcast trailer, and my fingers found their rhythm immediately. The years of trawling through Love Island clips, finding the perfect lines and cutting them together to make a sizzle have paid off! Suddenly I felt very grateful for those moments when my laptop was overheating and I was tempted to throw it off the Fremantle balcony to the street below. It also confirmed what I suspected all along - my skills are in fact transferable?! This is what marketing managers are missing - TV people are narrative experts. They understand pacing, tension, and how to hook an audience in seconds. I have been trained by mentors who live and breathe storytelling. Sure, they might not know what ROAS means (yet) and they probably haven't built an Instagram to thousands. But they can make your content incredibly watchable. There's an entire industry packed with storytellers looking to branch into new industries and new ways of making content. They've spent years making reality TV addictive. Imagine what they could do with your brand story. Next time you're hiring for editor/content creator/marketer, consider a candidate without direct marketing experience. The person who made Love Island compulsive viewing might be exactly what your content strategy needs. If you like the trailer, the full episode is even better - give it a watch! 😉","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Dear hiring managers and editors, We don’t expect magic. We don’t expect handholding. Most of us don’t even expect a yes. But if you’re asking freelancers to pitch or apply, please consider a few basics: - State the pay rate. “Competitive” isn’t a rate. Neither is “TBD.” - Say if the role is filled. Ghosting isn’t a communications strategy. - Don’t ask for unpaid trial tasks. If you want to see how we write, read what we’ve written! - Include a name. “Dear writer” makes us all feel worse. - Give realistic timelines. If you won’t decide for three months, say so. - Don’t advertise ‘ongoing work’ if it’s one article. - If the piece is killable, say how much of the fee is guaranteed. - Reply to accepted pitches before the news cycle moves on. Have a little clarity and human decency, and you'll find freelancers who want to work hard for you, go the extra mile, and keep working with you for the long haul. You might be surprised by just how much that means to us. Yours sincerely, Freelancers everywhere","label":0}
{"text":"[LINKEDIN] 🚨 Based on a true event 🚨 Recently, someone reached out to me for video editing services. It started off seriously — ❓ What software do you use? ❓ What are your PC specs? ❓ What’s your internet speed? Basically, a whole interview like they were hiring a #NASA editor. But when I asked about the budget... 💀 \"500 rupees per short video.\" Excuse me… WHAT!? I was genuinely stunned. In 2025, someone expects #high-quality edits using After Effects and Premiere Pro — tools that require skill, time, and powerful hardware — for the price of a street snack. Let’s not forget, I’ve spent 3 years mastering this craft. This isn't just clicking buttons — it’s storytelling, color theory, transitions, keyframing, sound design — the whole cinematic experience. And yes, 9 out of 10 times, it's always someone from #Pakistan or #India on platforms like #Upwork or #Fiverr who thinks #editing is just dragging and dropping clips. They don’t value creativity or the time and talent that goes into this work. It’s sad, really. 🧠 To all #freelancers out there: Know your worth. Set your rates. And say \"NO\" to exploitation.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] There's a new world order for how to compete in business, and I did a 27 min pod on how we got here/where we're going and what that means for media and marketing. If you're curious but have no time to listen, here's the gist: In 2021, 0% interest rates made companies flush with cash, which made google/facebook ads oversaturated, which made brand building important again. Around the same time, HubSpot's founder Dharmesh Shah decided it was a good time to buy The Hustle and launch a full on media company for business builders. Brands had been toying around with hiring journalists/building media for years, but a mix of a) necessity to move beyond demand gen as it became less efficient, and b) the company that literally coined the term \"Inbound\" tripling down on media, both acted as catalysts. The past five years, hundreds of brands have hired managing editors, economists, etc, to put out authority building content. To exacerbate things, launching a company is now easier than ever. AI has made it so english majors can build software. And in a world where it's harder to differentiate on product.... distribution separates the winners from the losers. In 2025 (and beyond), you must compete on brand. That is why brands are hiring journalists in droves and launching media arms. That is why I am posting on LinkedIn. It's a new world order, and I had a hell of a time talking with Jeff Barrett about it. Or you can listen to full pod here: https://lnkd.in/e_GFPEaH","label":0}

It is 100% worth the smallish financial commitment and the time, and will set you up for success. I found my editors in online groups I joined for my genre of book and on Fiverr.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Day 36 #0to30DhumiAI to #30to100DhumiAI 🎬 “One blog post. Ten videos. Zero editing headaches.” 🚀 Here’s a small truth about content — most brands write way more than they show. We were guilty too. Blogs? Dozens of them. Great info, solid keywords — but once published, they’d just sit there gathering digital dust. No reels. No snackable video clips. No life beyond the page. Hiring a video editor for every little blog? Didn’t make sense. Trying to do it ourselves? Way too clunky. Then we found Lumen5 — an underrated gem for turning text into scroll-stopping videos in minutes. All we do now is drop a blog link or paste in our text → Lumen5’s AI picks out key phrases, matches it with stock clips and music → boom, we’ve got a shareable video for LinkedIn, Insta, or email campaigns. No learning Premiere Pro. No briefing freelancers. No overthinking visuals or music rights. One of our blogs about AI dashboards? We turned it into ten short videos last month — each one driving way more views than the original article ever did. So now, instead of pushing a post once and moving on, we stretch it. One piece → multiple formats → fresh reach, new eyeballs. It’s not fancy Hollywood magic. It’s practical AI doing what we don’t have time for. Quiet ROI nobody sees — but the numbers speak. #DhumiAI #0to30DhumiAI #Lumen5 #ContentRepurposing #AIForMarketing #WorkSmarter","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Read this if you're a company that wants to have a successful YouTube brand channel. These 5 harsh truths that will increase your chances of succeeding. - First off.. Leave your ego at the door. I don't care if you've worked at Apple, or Google, or if you've been a traditional marketer for 20 years. YouTube is a different beast. It's completely different from every other platform. Let the specialists do their job, don't micro-manage, and be willing to learn. - Hire editors who have experience with YouTube, not who come from mainstream backgrounds. It's a completely different skillset. - Hire thumbnail designers who know how to make a good YouTube thumbnail, not a graphic designer who has been 'traditionally' trained. - Hire a YouTube specialist to develop your strategy. Ideation, packaging, editing style, and retention strategy. Not a 'social media manager' who has little specialized experience with the platform. - Build your brand with your content, not your thumbnails. They're not their to be artsy, they're there to get clicks.","label":0}
{"text":"[LINKEDIN] The Art of Professional Video Editing: Clean Cuts, Seamless Transitions, and the Power of Remote Work In today’s fast-paced digital world, high-quality video content is essential for businesses to stand out. But what separates an amateur edit from a polished, professional corporate video? The answer lies in precision, storytelling, and seamless transitions—not flashy effects that distract from the message. What Does Professional Video Editing Look Like? A well-edited corporate video should: ✅ Focus on clarity – Smooth cuts that maintain flow without confusing the viewer. ✅ Use subtle transitions – Cross dissolves, dip-to-black, or match cuts that feel natural, not dizzying. ✅ Maintain consistent pacing – Keeping engagement high without rushing or dragging scenes. ✅ Enhance storytelling – Every cut should serve the narrative, not just showcase editing skills. ✅ Prioritize audio quality – Clean voiceovers, balanced music, and crisp sound design. Overly flashy transitions (like spins, glitches, or excessive zoom effects) can make a corporate video feel unprofessional. Instead, smooth, purposeful edits build trust and keep the focus on the content. The Benefits of Hiring a Remote Video Editor Many businesses hesitate to outsource video editing, but working with a skilled remote editor offers major advantages: 🌍 Access to top talent – No geographical limits means you can hire the best editors worldwide. 💰 Cost-effective – No need for in-house staff or expensive equipment—just pay for the final product. ⏱ Faster turnaround – Professional editors work efficiently, delivering high-quality edits on schedule. 📈 Scalability – Easily scale up video production without hiring full-time employees. 🔄 Flexible collaboration – Cloud-based tools (Frame.io, Dropbox, Google Drive) make feedback and revisions seamless. Whether it’s a company promo, training video, or social media ad, a professionally edited video elevates your brand—without unnecessary distractions. Final Thoughts Great editing is invisible. It guides the viewer effortlessly through the story, reinforcing your message rather than overshadowing it. And with remote video editors, businesses can achieve high-quality results efficiently and cost-effectively. Need a professionally edited corporate video?

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Google Veo 3 in Poland – a new era of video creation with the help of artificial intelligence Google Veo 3 – artificial intelligence creating videos with sound now in Poland! 🚀 I find that few things in the marketing industry can surprise me today, but the debut of Veo 3 from Google really brought a smile. The new model can not only generate a video from just text but also add super realistic sound: voices, effects, background noise – all synchronized. Sounds like fun from the future? For content creators and marketers, it's not a joke but a tool I actually use daily. What does Veo 3 offer? - A video ready to upload to social media or use in presentations is created from a text prompt – no crews, graphic designers, or editors needed. - It intelligently understands even complex commands, preserves characters, styles, and fluidity of the image. - Allows combining short clips into larger sequences (Flow module) – super convenient for courses or mini marketing series. - Enables full integration with Gemini, Slides, or even make.com, n8n – automation at your fingertips. I personally tested Veo 3, among other things, for quick client presentations and safety training animations – I reduced the waiting time from weeks to hours, and clients smiled broadly. Sure – it won't replace the intuition of a human director yet, but imagine how much energy you'll save on simple, repetitive productions! See the potential? Veo 3 will open up a world where every marketer, business owner, or educator can create clips on their own terms. More examples, ready prompts, and tips can be found in my article on the blog – I invite you: In Polish: https://lnkd.in/dwpNmci2 In English: https://lnkd.in/dv52DN6q #AIMarketingMasters #B2BMarketingAutomation #MarketingEkspercki #DariuszCiesielski Źródło: https://lnkd.in/durqXXzD","label":0}

Sometimes you just have to let go of the story.” Deliver the best copy you can. Blow a deadline if what you have is truly subpar.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] I'm thrilled to announce that this is my first week as Editorial Director-at-Large at Lerner Publishing Group! I'll be shaping the list for Kar-Ben, Lerner's imprint specializing in Jewish picture books. To answer three questions you might about my new role: Q: \"What are you acquiring and how can I submit to you?\" A: I don't know yet! I'm starting by familiarizing myself with Kar-Ben's existing list and working on the books already signed up. I know I'll be looking for Jewish children's books, mostly picture books, with the occasional board book and short MG. That's as far as I've gotten. Once I have a better sense of the direction we want to take the list, I'll have much more to say on this matter. So stay tuned! Q: \"Are you shutting down The Book Engineer?\" A: Nope! Because I'm Editorial Director *at large*, I'm still keeping room in my schedule for other editing, writing, and book packaging. I like this setup because it means I don't need to part ways with my wonderful existing clients, and it means that I can work on a broader range of books (even those that aren't relevant to Kar-Ben's mission). If you've been around my LinkedIn page for a while, you know how interested I am in helping consumer-facing brands share their stories and connect with their audiences through books, and that remains a priority of the Book Engineer. Q: \"How did you get this job?\" A: This is something I always wonder when I see other people post job announcements, so I figured you might be wondering, too. Here's the story: Four years ago, a Lerner editor needed someone to babysit her books while she was on leave. My old boss recommended me for the gig. I shepherded the editor's books while she was out, and then, when she returned to work, she asked me to freelance edit another couple books in the next season. She has a fantastic list, so of course I said yes. She asked me the same question for the following season, and the season after. I've now edited a total of 25 books for Lerner. So when another Lerner imprint, Kar-Ben, needed an editorial director, I was someone whom they thought of because they were already working with me. It's an incredible opportunity. Without patting myself on the back overly much, I'm going to say that I think the moral of the story is: Sometimes, if you do good work, people will want to work with you.","label":0}
{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Malini Devadas has been editing for 21 years and freelancing for 12 and in that time, the world has changed so much. There are more and more editors coming into the marketplace every day, social media is not as easy to use for marketing as it used to be, and the rise of AI means that some writers think that they can bypass using a human editor altogether. On top of that, the cost of living is ever-increasing, so while editors need to charge more to earn a living, clients may not have the budgets that they once had. But it's not all doom and gloom! Once you understand how much money you need to charge (hint, it's probably more than you realise!), who your clients are and the problem that you solve for them, you can create a realistic marketing plan that you can actually implement. Malini Devadas will deliver this workshop on finding clients in 2025 using timeless business principles at the IPEd Conference. Bookings close Wednesday 9 July. 🎟️ https://lnkd.in/ghTaygp9","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] The first time we moved to Asia with our 2 young kids, we had a 7 hour layover in China. The airline offered hotel vouchers due to the long layover, and not wanting to be with a 3 and 1 year old in a Chinese airport for that long (okay any airport, but also their little blonde heads were attracting a lot of picture-taking), we took them up on it. We figured it would be like most airports here, with a hotel attached to the airport or down the road. So we followed instructions to get a cab, and figured it would be pretty close. Turns out it was a 15 minute drive through the city. In hindsight, this could have been super sketch, so thanks God for protecting us in our naivety. Anyway, we were pretty pumped because we can now say we’ve been to China, which no self respecting traveler would say if they only flew into the airport, and soon, arrived at our hotel. Power was out when we arrived. Literally checked-in speaking through Google Translate. Someone had slipped a business card into the room under the door, a woman who wished to do business in the hotel room (strange place to run a business, right? Wonder what industry she was in! 🫠). But whatever, we weren’t being kidnapped and we were actually in China. AND we had a bed and room to nap in. I plopped onto the bed and BANG. It was like landing on concrete. The smack reverberated up my spine and rattled my teeth. What even is this place?! So much for sleep. Too busy wondering, laughing, having a back ache. We went out for a walk and tried to buy a water. It turned out to be a clear pop of some kind. Gross. But cool, we engaged with the local economy. We decided we were already deep into having an adventure, and went to the dingy hotel cafeteria. Exactly the same as a Best Western breakfast spread but noodles instead of anything else, and it wasn’t the same at all. We somehow got the hotel to call us a cab and made it back to the airport so we could catch our next flight to Bangkok. Very unexpected but fitting way to start a 2 year period of travel and living in Thailand and Bulgaria! What’s the point? Mostly it’s a reminder to myself that the most interesting parts of life, family, business, adventure start with a wild, unusual decision. Something that most people would go “lol are you crazy” (heard this often). A decision and conviction that this path is TOTALLY out of your comfort level and mostly out of your control, but that the payoff is going to be exponentially bigger and better than doing what everyone expects you to do. Our married life is defined by many of these decisions and it’s so much more fun, rewarding, and packed with forced-growth! Same with the podcast I started out of FOMO a few years ago that led to closing $200k in the first 9 months of my group coaching program. Sorry LI, gotta balance personal stories and “btw if you need help launching or editing your podcast I know a guy” (it’s me). Thanks for reading!","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] 🚨 DEATH OF THE CODE EDITOR 🚨 I'm calling it. Writing software used to mean living in your code editor.... Fixing bugs by copy-and-pasting from Google an Stack Overflow. Then came ChatGPT – still copy-paste, but at least the robot wrote the draft. Github Copilot followed: an editor extension which was AI autocomplete on steroids. Editors like Cursor then took a massive lead - full AI-enabled code editors that reads your whole repo, adds files, writes tests. Then in-editor background agents allowed AI to multi-task... No more waiting 3 minutes for a response - we could spawn 10 agentic AI workers in our editor, running parallel tasks and us acting as the conductor of the symphony. But I believe the code editor is short-lived. And this pains me, as editors mean a lot to developers. (I still love Sublime Text, the first code editor I fell in love with). 🤖 Cursor just unleashed autonomous AI agents on the web + mobile. This means from a web app, your phone, a Slack message, or soon to be any number of communication channels, you can send an autonomous AI agent to work. Writing your code, fixing your bugs, doing a deep-dive investigation - no code editor required. Tools like Devin took the lead with this - but I think we are about to see it go mainstream. I believe this is a reason why all the big AI labs have released command line AI coding tools - OpenAI's Codex, Claude Code, and now Gemini CLI. Unlike fully fledged GUI code editors, command line programs can *easly* be used in a headless environment, meaning an environment where it might not be a human interacting with the command line - but another AI. I believe this is the start of a bigger shift: if AI can read, write and refactor code without an IDE, the bottleneck isn’t coding – it’s telling the AI exactly what to build. My guess? The new “coding will be crystal-clear requirements that every human can read and every AI agent can execute. The future will be... interesting. Thoughts? Come at me.","label":0}
{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Netflix has just patented a new method for extracting the most compelling moments from shows and movies to create trailers and clips with no human editor required. The goal? Better recommendations, more clicks, and more watch time. The system builds trailers and previews based on things like which characters appear on screen or how scenes are sequenced. Clip curation is labor-intensive, and it could be biased. (Don’t like the lead actor? You might skip their best scene.) Netflix says automation solves that, helping them scale content discovery across their massive library. It’s part of a bigger push to improve how we find shows: new home screens, vertical video feeds, even Emmy-award badges to help titles stand out. #Netflix #StreamingTech #AI #MarketingInnovation #ContentDiscovery","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] 2025 SEO Trends You Can’t Afford to Ignore If you're planning to use the same old SEO tactics in 2025, you’re already behind. Search is evolving fast—and so are Google’s expectations. Here are the essential trends shaping SEO in 2025 that you cannot afford to ignore: ✅ 1. AI Content Needs Human Editing Everyone’s using AI to churn out content. But Google can detect low-quality, generic AI text—and it’s cracking down. Winning strategy: Use AI for speed and ideation. Always human-edit for tone, clarity, and authority. 2025 SEO = Hybrid content workflows. ✅ 2. Search is Omnichannel Now SEO isn’t just about Google anymore. Your customers search on: TikTok (how-tos, trends) YouTube (reviews, demos) Reddit (real discussions) Amazon (buying intent) Brands must optimize for all discovery channels. “If you're only ranking on Google, you're missing half your audience.” ✅ 3. Zero-Click SERPs Are the New Normal Google’s SERPs are flooded with featured snippets, AI overviews, and instant answers. Users get what they need without clicking. 2025 priority: Optimize for visibility in these snippets. Focus on brand presence, not just traffic. ✅ 4. Topic Clusters Outperform Random Posts Google prefers structured authority over content spam. Key approach: Build content hubs with interlinked, in-depth articles. Demonstrate topic expertise at scale. Clusters = Authority. ✅ 5. E-E-A-T is Non-Negotiable Google is doubling down on Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust. To rank in 2025, your content needs: Real author bios and credentials. Verified expertise. Transparent trust signals. Generic, anonymous writing gets buried. ✅ 6. User Experience is a Ranking Factor Google’s ranking systems now heavily factor: Load times (under 2 seconds). Accessibility. Mobile-first design. Clean, engaging layouts. “Good UX isn’t optional—it’s SEO.” ✅ 7. Link Building is About Relationships Low-quality link exchanges are obsolete. 2025 SEO link strategy: Partnerships. Co-marketing. Genuine thought leadership. Natural citations. Google values trust signals, not tricks. ✅ 8. SGE and Structured Data Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) is mainstream in 2025. Smart brands: Use structured data and schema. Make content easy for AI overviews to digest. Optimize for FAQs, how-tos, and clear sections. ⚡ Final Thought SEO in 2025 isn’t about chasing algorithms—it’s about genuinely serving your audience wherever they search. If you’re not adapting to these trends, you’re not just falling behind—you’re disappearing. ✅ Which of these trends are you already working on?

Political campaigns & business brands — delivering professional, branded videos Over the last 4+ years, I’ve learned that successful content creation isn’t just about software — it’s about: ✔️ Telling a story that connects ✔️ Delivering polished, consistent videos ✔️ Understanding how to edit for each platform If you're struggling with YouTube video editing, tired of spending hours trying to perfect your social media content, or simply want a reliable freelance video editor, I’m here to help. Let me handle the technical side — so you can focus on growing your brand.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] A few days ago, I learned a hard but valuable lesson as a freelance video editor. I was approached by a US recruiter on LinkedIn for what seemed like a great opportunity, a full-time video editing role for a YouTube channel. At first I was unsure whether to proceed or not, but when I saw that most of the people in my network follow The said recruiter, I thought, why not give it a try? I was excited, motivated, and ready to bring my best. I was asked to do a test task, which I invested a lot of time, effort, and research into. I submitted the project and then… nothing. No response. No feedback. Complete silence. I’ll be honest, it hurt. I felt used, discouraged, and for a moment, I even questioned myself. But here’s what I realized: ✅ Always clarify if a test task is paid. ✅ Protect your work watermark or send a lower-resolution version. ✅ If a client or recruiter disappears after receiving your work, it says more about them than it does about you. ✅ Use every project, even the unpaid ones, to sharpen your skills and build your portfolio. I'm still extremely passionate about telling stories through video. This experience didn’t break me; it taught me. And I’m moving forward with more awareness, strength, and clarity. To fellow editors, creatives, and freelancers: trust your process, protect your energy, and never let one “no” or silence define your journey. 💪 #VideoEditing #FreelanceLife #LessonsLearned #CreativeJourney #StorytellingThroughVideo","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Dear companies, Can we stop pretending internships are only for college students? Sincerely, A postgrad girl with ambitions, three degrees, and zero internship openings to apply for. Look, job hunting already feels like trying to survive Miranda Priestly’s office with no fashion sense, no connections, and no clue what cerulean is—but the pressure? Still sky-high. Then add in the whole “entry-level but must have 3 years of experience” thing, and suddenly I’m not even qualified to apply. How exactly am I supposed to get experience if all the doors are locked and I don’t have the secret student key anymore? Not all of us knew our dream job at 18.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Just finished scraping 1243 freelance video editing job posts across Reddit, LinkedIn, and Twitter—and running them all through ChatGPT for analysis. The insights completely flipped how I look at the freelance video editing world. Biggest surprise: Motion Graphics rules the game. I assumed tools like After Effects or Premiere would dominate job descriptions, but the term “Motion Graphics” popped up way more often than anything else. Clients clearly crave dynamic, animated content far beyond standard cutting and editing. Some other things that stood out: Mondays are hot for job posts. There were 80% more listings on Mondays than Sundays. So if you’re applying, timing could be everything. Color grading isn’t in demand like you’d think. Despite being a premium skill, barely anyone specifically requests it in job posts. I’m planning to dig deeper into this data—maybe explore how rates vary by skill or platform next.","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] 5 years ago, when I was 12, I got fascinated by video editing. While most kids played outside, I was learning how to edit videos using just my phone and YouTube. I shared my video editing work in a group. Someone reached out. I didn’t have a laptop, so I offered to work in exchange for one. He agreed and that one laptop opened a new world for me. After some time, I felt video editing wasn’t for me. So I kept exploring and that’s when I discovered copywriting. My first copy looked like a whole novel 😅 But I kept learning, practicing and improving. Over time, I started working with clients across the US, UK, France and more. People often told me: “Just focus on studies.” But I always believed in learning skills alongside education. I’m still a student. - Still learning. - Still building. - Still working on my dreams.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] 🎬 5 Client Red Flags That Slow Down Video Projects Smooth collaboration is the backbone of a successful video editing project. But when certain client behaviours go unchecked, they can derail timelines, drain creative energy, and lead to frustration on both ends. Here are five common client red flags that slow down video projects—plus how editors can handle them like pros. 1. Vague or Incomplete Project Briefs When a client sends over a vague brief (or none at all), you're left guessing about the vision, tone, style, and deliverables. This leads to unnecessary back-and-forth, misaligned edits, and wasted time. ✓ Use a project brief template to collect clear objectives, references, deadlines, and platforms ✓ Ask direct questions to fill gaps early ✓ Don’t begin until the brief is agreed upon Pro Tip: No clarity = no efficiency. Always secure a strong foundation first. 2. Scope Creep & Endless Revisions Some clients keep adding tasks or asking for “one more tiny edit” long after the scope is set. Without boundaries, this eats into time and profit, and derails your editing queue. ✓ Set clear revision limits in your proposal or contract ✓ Communicate what's included vs. chargeable extras ✓ Gently redirect when new tasks arise unexpectedly Pro Tip: Stick to the agreed scope. Free rein = no finish line. 3. Unrealistic Deadlines & Rush Requests When clients want high-quality videos in 24 hours, they often don’t grasp the editing process. Rushing can compromise quality and create stress—for both parties. ✓ Educate clients on realistic timelines based on the project type ✓ Suggest better alternatives if the deadline is too tight ✓ Say no to projects that compromise your standards Pro Tip: Fast, good, or cheap—pick two. Don’t sacrifice your process for pressure. 4. Poor Communication & Delayed Feedback Delayed replies or vague feedback like “make it pop” can bring your progress to a halt. Lack of timely approvals means stalled timelines and bottlenecks. ✓ Set communication expectations early—how often, through what platform, and by when ✓ Use tools like Frame.io, Notion, or timestamped comments for clarity ✓ Pause work if feedback is repeatedly delayed Pro Tip: Your timeline is only as efficient as their feedback loop. 5. Undervaluing Your Time & Effort Some clients expect premium edits for bottom-dollar rates or “exposure.” Others want unlimited revisions at no extra cost. This devalues your skills and leads to burnout. ✓ Be transparent about pricing, revision policies, and what’s included ✓ Don’t negotiate against your own worth ✓ Walk away if respect isn’t mutual Pro Tip: Value your work—because clients model their respect off how you set boundaries. 🎯 Final Thoughts The best video projects come from mutual respect and clear communication. Spotting red flags early and setting boundaries protects your time, creativity, and peace of mind. Communicate clearly. Set expectations early. Protect your process.","label":0}

But here’s what actually works (and what we now teach editors in our coaching program):👇 ⸻ ✅ 1. Niche Portfolio > Random Work Don’t just show off “cool edits.” Build a portfolio around one niche – like: • YouTube channels • Podcasts • Real estate • Influencers • E-learning creators 🎯 Specialists get hired. Generalists get ignored. ⸻ ✅ 2. LinkedIn is Your Secret Weapon Most editors ignore it. That’s a mistake. Here’s what we help our students do: → Write a killer headline & bio → Add a “Featured” section with your best work → Get real endorsements → Use niche-specific keywords to get discovered by recruiters ⸻ ✅ 3. Speak Like a Pro (Even if You’re a Beginner) It’s not just “Can you edit?” It’s → “Can you explain your value clearly in interviews and DMs?” We help editors master job-winning communication that makes recruiters listen. ⸻ ✅ 4. Our 4-Week Job-Getting System Yes, it’s possible to get paid ₹15K–₹35K/month (without a fancy degree or big client list). Whether you’re a student, dropout, or struggling freelancer – this roadmap helps you land real paid editing gigs in 30 days or less. ⸻ 🎯 Tired of being overlooked? 💸 Done working for free? 💥 Ready to finally break into the industry and earn with confidence? 👇 Comment “Clarity” and I’ll DM you a free action plan to get your first (or next) paid job as a video editor.","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] It’s reported that Paramount has agreed to pay USD16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump over the “60 Minutes” interview with then–Vice President Kamala Harris. The timing is notable, as Paramount seeks approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission for its USD8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media. Some U.S. senators have accused Paramount of offering a quid pro quo to facilitate the merger. I don’t have the legal expertise and am not in a position to assess this claim—but from a PR standpoint, this case is a rather bizarre one. The incident originated during Harris’s presidential campaign against Trump. In a CBS “60 Minutes” interview, she was asked about the Israel–Hamas war. Her “word salad” response—a meandering 179-word “word salad”—was later edited down to just 20 words, presumably to make her appear more coherent. Trump then sued the network, alleging election interference. From a communications management perspective, several missteps stand out: It seems CBS has been friendly to Harris’s camp. Her team should have been alerted of the interview topics in advance and rehearsed answers accordingly. Why didn’t they? The interview was pre-recorded, not live. If her response to the Israel question was deemed unsatisfactory, there was ample opportunity to re-record. Why didn’t anyone—Harris, her team, or the producer—flag this in the moment? Strangely, only during post-production did the editor decide to “fix” it. Harris reportedly spent over USD1 billion on her campaign—a high-stakes endeavor in the most pivotal chapter of her political career. Yet, despite such immense resources, even the most fundamental aspects of media handling appear to have been overlooked. As someone who has worked in strategic communications for four decades, I find this genuinely surprising. #trump #kamalaharris #CBS #Paramount #60minutes","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] I’ve had brands come in doing $1-2M/yr, spending like crazy on video, UGC, and animation packages. But when I ask what offers they’ve actually tested, the answer is always the same: \"We haven’t really done that.\" You’re telling me you’ve tested 90 hooks, 20 thumbnails, 15 edits… …but you’ve never tested a bundle, shipping thresholds, never touched the pricing? Offer testing isn’t flashy. It doesn’t look good in a deck, and it won’t win you any design awards. But it’s arguably the fastest way to turn a \"good\" brand into something that can really scale.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] I feel like I see a collective backing away from the job title \"Editor,\" and, I have to say, I really don't care for it. I've gone by the new names, been a Communications Manager and currently work as a Content Specialist. It's fine I guess, but the secret sauce to my professional success is that I'm a damn good editor. Of course \"editor\" feels like an old-timey profession, master of the ink age and all that. That's kind of true: Editorial expertise is resilient and time-honored. But in an age of \"Innovation Evangelists\" and \"AI Prompt Engineers,\" I welcome a job title that my great-grandparent could have held. This era particularly needs editors. Those who can organize words and ideas efficiently, sniff out truth in a roomful of liars, wrangle the madness of a news cycle that has grown to encompass everything, everywhere, all the time. So the editorial calendar is in Asana or Airtable instead of pinned to the wall of a corner office. The stories post to social media and email newsletters rather than newspapers or (*sigh*) printed magazine. All the writers are AI agents or maybe not but probably (I hope not). Everything can change, in ways both good and bad, but one thing will always stay the same: We need editors. To gather people, ideas and words, and make it all work. To get stuff out on time. To develop a vision and strategy that actually connects with a wide and diverse audience that could not care less about internal revenue reports or (*shudder*) Canva decks. And yes, of course, to read through the AI slop and say, \"No, this is all wrong. I'm going to call so-and-so to fix this.\" We need editors to hold the line in a world that keeps forgetting truth matters. Call me whatever you gotta to get the direct deposit approved, but know that *I know* I'm an editor and proud to be so. #editor","label":0}
{"text":"[LINKEDIN] I used to spend an hour recording one video. Had to make sure I wasn't sick, my hair looked good, lighting was perfect, quiet room. Five or six takes every time. Now I create content from bed. I wake up, scroll through my phone, see breaking AI news like \"Johnny Ive and Sam Altman are releasing some new device.\" I take that news story, put it into ChatGPT and say \"write the most viral 30-second short form video script you can imagine.\" Then I take what it generates and put it into my AI cloned voice. All of a sudden my voice has read that script and I'm ready to start editing. Three months ago I cloned my voice using Eleven Labs. Game changer. I'm doing this for clients too now. My dad only spent one hour giving me his audio sample and a picture. Now he gets a video released every day without lifting a finger. Same with a bankruptcy lawyer I work with. He tried recording content before but had no luck. Now his AI avatar gets thousands of views talking about bankruptcy law. The workflow is simple: 10% human upfront, 80% AI, 10% human editing at the end. You still need human editors to put it all together and make good visuals. AI isn't there yet for that part. But for the actual content creation? The voice, the script, the initial idea? AI handles all of that now. Anyone can do this. Clone your voice, use AI for script ideas, and build content around your business niche. Whether you like it or not, your name and face are a brand when you interact on social media. Why not have AI working on your behalf to grow that brand?","label":0}

It's completely different from every other platform. Let the specialists do their job, don't micro-manage, and be willing to learn. - Hire editors who have experience with YouTube, not who come from mainstream backgrounds. It's a completely different skillset. - Hire thumbnail designers who know how to make a good YouTube thumbnail, not a graphic designer who has been 'traditionally' trained. - Hire a YouTube specialist to develop your strategy. Ideation, packaging, editing style, and retention strategy.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Some of the best creatives I’ve worked with wouldn’t make it past the first stage in most hiring processes. Not necessarily because they’re not good enough. But because I still think ‘the system’ we use for hiring now doesn’t know how to spot them. They don’t have the right job titles or a perfectly worded CV that might please the algorithms of job sites, recruiters etc. They might be self-taught, career-switchers. Or, they might have been so deep in work that they haven’t had time to make themselves perfect for that system, they are just talented, and that's what makes them different. The more I look through LinkedIn and review hiring processes, it's still a really apparent problem. I still see so much of creative hiring based on filtering for what looks good on paper, when in reality, we all know that's not the case. Often, people who are really creative can be dyslexic and not able to properly formulate a CV as well as others. If you are hiring a video editor, for example, should their writing skills be a differentiating factor? The reality is that some of the most exciting, original, collaborative creatives don’t always ‘tick boxes’ or meet salary bandings. Which, to me, especially when I think about the volume with which we are dealing with applicants now, combined with the internal cultures at creative places, still seems slightly strange. I think it’s also best to preface this thought with the fact that I actually do think small, boutique places are better at this now compared to larger outfits, so maybe that’s my answer lol. And when I say I don’t think we do it properly, I’m not talking about lowering the bar in terms of who we are hiring and just giving anyone a chance. But I’d love to see us move away from names on CVs and start valuing potential as much as polish, understanding what someone could do, not just what they’ve already had the chance to do etc. Obviously, it is just a fact that it's currently way harder to do this with the pure volume of applicants that talent teams face, but it’s still possible. Hiring is the most important thing any business does. I still find it strange that a lot of places don’t treat it as such.

Treating their videos like a tick box, as opposed to a powerful tool that, once mastered, can change their business forever. I spent £50,000 to learn that. Don't do the same. Take your videos seriously 👌🏻 --- This is the lead magnet I was talking about. https://lnkd.in/eP-wzm5k 🔗","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] We were finally profitable and growing. So, we risked it all on a bet that doing unscalable work would unlock something bigger. In late 2019, our golf instruction YouTube channel was finally picking up steam. We were filming, producing, and posting three new videos every week. We were growing at a good rate and making revenue. It was also funneling our audience into our membership site. We had plenty of work to do and were in a growth phase. Eric Cogorno and I faced a choice: stay comfortable in Pennsylvania that winter and keep building on our momentum or commit to something that made no logical sense — maintain our three-videos-per-week YouTube schedule while filming instructional content with top golf instructors across the entire United States. We chose the path that didn't scale. It would have been easier to hire editors, use local crews, or stay put. Instead, we decided to do everything ourselves while traveling coast-to-coast for five months. Here's what doing unscalable work looked like: • Eric drove coast-to-coast, handling all coordination and content development • I flew to meet him for 3-week legs, managing all camera gear, filming all content, and handling all post-production • We filmed with incredible golf instructors across the country at prestigious locations like Monterey Peninsula Country Club and Superstition Mountain • Every single night, I was in hotel rooms uploading footage, editing, and posting • All while both of us continued managing the daily requirements of our content and online coaching business What could possibly go wrong with this plan...?","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Falling in love with your website and business — is that even a thing? Yes. Yes, it absolutely is. Since upgrading to Moodle 4.5, the Natural Perfume Academy feels like it’s running on silk. Every page, every module, every interaction is smoother, smarter, and more powerful. I genuinely feel like I’ve fallen in love—with my own website. 💖 Here’s why Moodle 4.5 has me swooning: • Smarter, faster navigation Sticky headers, upgraded filters, and an interface that just flows—navigating our courses is now effortless. • Bite-sized, beautifully organised Subsections let us structure our content more clearly. Perfect for layering complex perfumery modules. • AI tools built in No clunky plugins—Moodle’s AI integration works right from the editor. Create, summarise, even generate images. • Multimedia-rich editor Need to demo how to scent beeswax or filter a tincture? Just hit record—no extra software needed. • Better engagement with badges and alerts With Open Badges 3.0 and streamlined notifications, learners stay connected and motivated. • Long-term support and stability Moodle 4.5 is an LTS release. That means long-term updates, serious security, and peace of mind. But it’s not just the features—it’s the ethics that seal the deal. ⸻ Why We Chose Moodle — and Why That Matters We’re not just building beautiful courses. We’re building them on ethical ground. Moodle is open-source, community-built, and fiercely independent. No corporate overlords. No middlemen. No data harvesting. 💡 Did you know? Many corporate platforms—like Blackboard and even Canvas education suite—are based on cuttings from Moodle’s original code. They’ve been rebranded, monetised, and restricted, all in the name of profit. Moodle is different: ✅ Truly open-source — Anyone can audit or adapt the code ✅ Ethically hosted — We run NPA on a private server based in Oranmore Co Galway, not corporate cloud ✅ No data selling — Your data is yours, full stop ✅ No licensing bloat — No fees feeding investors, just a thriving global community ✅ Built by educators, for educators — A platform grounded in learning, not money At NPA, we don’t just teach ethical practice—we live it. Even in the very bones of our Academy. This isn’t just a website. It’s a movement. Powered by Moodle. Rooted in integrity. And yes—it’s possible to fall in love with that.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Really important point here: precision is essential, but unecessary detail is more than just unnecessary. It can be misleading and distract from the point you need to make. Writers and editors need to think: what does *my* reader need to know to come to the conclusion I want? What can I filter out that will make it easier to understand, less heavy (and thus more effective) to read? A secondary point is when extra details are important, but would be better off in a footnote so as not to interrupt the narrative.","label":0}
{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Vogue is a fashion magazine designed to influence, advise, and update high society consumers on the trendiest brands, styles, and social etiquettes of a particular time and geographic location. Vogue has built a brand on luxury goods, services, and events that has not always considered Black people due to the racial wealth gap that is still present globally today. Currently the majority of Black people around the globe live in extreme poverty. In America, this means that Black people live in cities or “Urban communities”. Though a number of Blacks live in rural and suburban areas, it isn’t the norm. Thus, many of these families must conform to White society to fit into their communities. For many, this means thinking, behaving, dressing, and identifying with White culture. As of today there are few thriving wealthy Black communities that have been shaped and designed by Black people. Even African countries like Cape Town, South Africa are designed by and for European settlers. Magazines’ (such as Vogue) inclusivity is based on the current socio economic structure of society. With European brands leading in fashion, architecture, and design, it is fitting that European’s lead in the conversations regarding luxury and high society. Allowing Urban fashion to enter the conversation poses a threat to the class divide. If what a Black editor has to contribute to Vogue are Urban ideals, this may aid in a rebranding of the magazine from a luxury fashion magazine to a fashion magazine. Allowing too many Urban ideas to plague the pages of Vogue compromises the foundation in which it was built on. A Black conformist, raised in uppercrust White society is likely to mimic previous editors. It isn’t likely that Urban ideas will rule at Vogue, ever. The fact that Blacks are brought to the table to contribute “Urban” ideas says that the expectation for Blacks is poverty or an understanding of it. A Black editor needs to bring a creative edge to the forefront that isn’t considered Urban or associated with struggle.","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Retention improved. No new features. Just better flow. Sharing this because we often chase retention through features, when the answer is already sitting in the product, unnoticed. In one of my projects, most users were skipping the content Library and jumping straight into building their own content pieces. It took them longer, didn’t spark much enthusiasm, and we couldn’t understand why Library usage was so low. We assumed users preferred creating from scratch. We also assumed the editor needed fixing. But after 10 user interviews, watching how they actually used the product, and running a deep path analysis, I found something else. The problem: 🟡 Users didn’t even see the value we had already built 🟡 The pop-ups explaining the Library were dismissed instantly 🟡 The flow nudged users into manual work when a faster, easier path was just one click away So instead of building new features, I proposed: ✅ Changing the entry point so new users start directly in the Content Library ✅ Renaming it to make it clearer ✅ Adding a strong CTA to guide them ✅ Reducing the number of decisions before they hit first value The result=> 📈 A 12 percent increase in Day 7 retention for new users Sometimes the product isn’t broken Just hidden.","label":0}

It involves strategy, analytics, scheduling, audience engagement, and keeping up with constantly changing trends.

Each requires its expertise, tools, and hours of work. Bundling these into a single role labeled “Social Media Manager” is not only unrealistic, it’s disrespectful to the people working in these fields. Hiring managers, please, let’s get real: ✅ If you need video editing, hire a video editor. ✅ If you want stunning visuals, work with a designer. ✅ If SEO is your goal, bring in an expert for that. ✅ If you need a charismatic presenter, hire a content creator who specializes in that. ✅ And if you want a strong social media presence, hire a social media manager for what they do.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Google Veo is officially making dreams come true! I've had this video visually play in my head for a couple years now (Vision: How podcasting actually helps you STAND OUT and MAKE CHANGE HAPPEN), but the time and cost it would take to produce it was just too much for my small business. Enter Google Veo #AIvideo. Here's the first prompt I used. It got me a DECENT video, but the transition wasn't smooth at all, and I couldn't get the correct camera angle in the recording space: ✍️ A dramatic aerial view of a large parade of people marching down a wide city street. The protesters look angry and upset, holding up oversized protest signs. The camera slowly zooms in from above, panning into the crowd until it focuses on one woman. She is passionately yelling along with the group. As the camera centers on her face, she closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. Then, she puts on headphones. The scene magically transitions—her surroundings dissolve away—and she is now sitting in a professional podcast recording studio. She looks passionate and engaged, speaking into a microphone, sharing her message with energy and focus. ❇️ After four more prompts, I realized I would need to actually prompt it with two videos, which I would then stitch together myself using Canva (ironically not a video editing program, but works like a charm). The most challenging part of the prompt was defining what the woman would look like so they matched in both videos. I also ended up having to add my own music. These two prompts got me my dream: ✍️ PROMPT 1: Please create a video. A young woman, 30, with expressive features and determined eyes and dark straight hair and brown eyes. She's facing the camera directly, both eyes directly looking into the camera. Surrounding her on both sides is a recording studio. In front of her is a microphone. Her eyes are first closed as she uses both hands to bring a pair of wired over-the-ear headphones up to place over her ears. She then opens her eyes and starts speaking. ✍️ PROMPT 2: Can you create a video of a large crowd of protestors marching down a large street in San Francisco. Can the video view be from above the crowd, looking out of over the crowd chanting and carrying large protest signs. Can you then move the camera view downward as if you're going in front of the crowd. Please have this exact woman you used for the recording studio (A young woman, 30, with expressive features and determined eyes and dark straight hair and brown eyes) standing at the front of the crowd. She's facing the camera directly, both eyes directly looking into the camera. She is yelling and surrounding her on both sides and behind her is the crowd of protestors. When the camera gets to her eye level, her eyes should close and then she uses both hands to bring a pair of wired over-the-ear headphones up to place over her ears.","label":0}

You can have the best camera, the sharpest shots, and the clearest audio… But if your colors are dull, your video won’t hold attention for long. Color grading is what gives your content flavor. It sets the mood, pulls viewers into the story, and instantly makes your video look more premium and professional.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] I'm not pivoting to strategy. Sure, the big money is in strategy, all the experts agree. The cool projects are in strategy, they add. The greatest rewards are in strategy, they insist. But what if you're not interested in doing strategy? Then you might pivot toward chasing stuff you don't want and getting stuff you don't appreciate. Why do that to yourself? If you're a strategist, more power to you. Strategy is an awesome thing, if you're a strategist. If we work together I'll put your plans into action. If I think your strategy needs a tweak, I'll bring it up. This is my thing: Since I started stringing words together for money back during the Reagan Administration, I've always felt more comfortable on the get-it-done side of things. In my newspaper days, I was the go-to guy for getting pages ready to publish. After that career went away, I found myself in the same wheelhouse - more writing than editing lately, but still: making good on other people's plans. This is the question you always have to ask yourself when pondering a pivot. Am I interested in doing that kind of work? You don't have to be passionate about it. Frankly, passion can send you on more wrong turns than right ones. But you must find the work interesting and worth doing. And the work must align with the person you see yourself as. It's fine to try new things and get outside your comfort zone. But if you're mulling a business pivot, do this first: — Ask somebody who has the job what it entails, in detail. — If you're shy, ask your favorite bot. Have it describe a hypothetical busy day on the job, with major points of stress and conflict. — Find out what the pay's like and what you have to go through to get it (landing clients, pitching projects, negotiating contracts, etc.) When I started freelancing, I saw myself as an editor. I chased editing gigs and made a decent living at it. But I found out that writing was much more lucrative, so I pivoted in that direction. (Now I gripe about the edits that I imposed on writers for years. Karma is real.) If you're itching to pivot, start small and scratch around a bit. If it feels right, do it some more. But don't let other people define your idea of success and talk you into stuff that doesn't feel right. (The only argument for doing that is learning why it's a bad idea first hand. Which is, come to think of it, the best way to learn. But I wouldn't recommend it).","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] I’m 𝗜𝗡𝗗𝗜𝗔𝗡. To me, mangoes were summer. Not elegant. Not beauty. Certainly not something you’d expect to see bottled in a bathroom. So when I saw a haircare brand using mango as a hero ingredient — I paused. Not because I disapproved. But because it had never occurred to me. The brand was called Love Lang Interesting formulation. A founder I respect Yushika Jolly💓 And a concept that was unique: Mango + Hyaluronic Shampoo.🙌 Tradition meets modern skin science. But when I clicked through to the product page… I felt nothing. There was a smiling model. Some fresh mangoes in a jute bag. A tiny bottle of shampoo held like a placeholder. No water. No shine. No movement. No emotion. It didn’t make me feel or want. It didn’t say \"shampoo.\" The visual had no direction. No sensory information. And when the brain doesn’t know what to look at, or how to feel — it forgets. I’m not a creative director. I don’t run a D2C brand. I don’t work in marketing. But I do notice things. And this image — which was supposed to introduce the product — said nothing..(for me) So I opened up ChatGPT. Not to redesign the brand. Not to show off. But to answer a quiet question: What would this image say if it spoke clearly? I started with the most obvious thing: I centered the product. Made it larger. Clearer. Unmistakable. Now, the eye lands exactly where it should. That’s not just aesthetics — it’s visual psychology. We trust what’s framed well. We notice what leads us. Then came the mango. In the original, it was background. Decorative. But the brain doesn’t process elements in isolation — it looks for meaning. So I sliced it. Let the pulp drip. Used its yellow in the background, the foam, the skin tone. Repetition builds connection. It tells the brain: this ingredient belongs here. Next: water. Foam. Wet hair. Droplets on the bottle. Skin that reflects light. Not just for “aesthetic” — but because our brains respond faster to touchable visuals. There’s a name for it: haptic visuality. When something looks like you could touch it, your brain engages. You don’t just see it — you feel it. I changed the model too. She wasn’t just smiling. She was present. In motion. Touching her scalp. Mid-moment. Because emotion doesn’t live in a frozen face — It lives in movement, in reaction, in that space just after touch. That’s what feels real. That’s what stays with us. What surprised me most? Not that I could do it quickly using AI — but how many tiny decisions made it work. Which direction the light came from. How much moisture was just enough. What skin tone supported mango yellow without clashing. Where the eye lands — and why. These aren’t filters or templates. They’re psychological cues. Signals to the part of the brain that feels before it thinks. #india #marketing #sharktank #content #hiring P.S: we are hiring video editor for my channel. Dm me with your portfolio😊","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Veo 3 still makes stupid mistakes.... Blinded and impressed with all the AI videos coming from Veo3, I tried it for a product ad video I wanted to make. My view is that it is still a very early model and not ready for mass use just yet. Creating any useable (not even great) clip takes extremely detailed prompts and need to cover every kind of mistake it could make (expensive retries on top of that!), and at that point it just may be better to hire a video creator for now.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] I’m 𝗜𝗡𝗗𝗜𝗔𝗡. To me, mangoes were summer. Not elegant. Not beauty. Certainly not something you’d expect to see bottled in a bathroom. So when I saw a haircare brand using mango as a hero ingredient — I paused. Not because I disapproved. But because it had never occurred to me. The brand was called Love Lang Interesting formulation. A founder I respect Yushika Jolly💓 And a concept that was unique: Mango + Hyaluronic Shampoo.🙌 Tradition meets modern skin science. But when I clicked through to the product page… I felt nothing. There was a smiling model. Some fresh mangoes in a jute bag. A tiny bottle of shampoo held like a placeholder. No water. No shine. No movement. No emotion. It didn’t make me feel or want. It didn’t say \"shampoo.\" The visual had no direction. No sensory information. And when the brain doesn’t know what to look at, or how to feel — it forgets. I’m not a creative director. I don’t run a D2C brand. I don’t work in marketing. But I do notice things. And this image — which was supposed to introduce the product — said nothing..(for me) So I opened up ChatGPT. Not to redesign the brand. Not to show off. But to answer a quiet question: What would this image say if it spoke clearly? I started with the most obvious thing: I centered the product. Made it larger. Clearer. Unmistakable. Now, the eye lands exactly where it should. That’s not just aesthetics — it’s visual psychology. We trust what’s framed well. We notice what leads us. Then came the mango. In the original, it was background. Decorative. But the brain doesn’t process elements in isolation — it looks for meaning. So I sliced it. Let the pulp drip. Used its yellow in the background, the foam, the skin tone. Repetition builds connection. It tells the brain: this ingredient belongs here. Next: water. Foam. Wet hair. Droplets on the bottle. Skin that reflects light. Not just for “aesthetic” — but because our brains respond faster to touchable visuals. There’s a name for it: haptic visuality. When something looks like you could touch it, your brain engages. You don’t just see it — you feel it. I changed the model too. She wasn’t just smiling. She was present. In motion. Touching her scalp. Mid-moment. Because emotion doesn’t live in a frozen face — It lives in movement, in reaction, in that space just after touch. That’s what feels real. That’s what stays with us. What surprised me most? Not that I could do it quickly using AI — but how many tiny decisions made it work. Which direction the light came from. How much moisture was just enough. What skin tone supported mango yellow without clashing. Where the eye lands — and why. These aren’t filters or templates. They’re psychological cues. Signals to the part of the brain that feels before it thinks. #Leadership #Career #branding #marketing #AI #content #hiring P.S: we are hiring video editor for my channel.

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] One of my favorite parts about hiring, as a freelance creative and not just a producer, is remembering this simple truth: Someone out there needs YOU, whether you realize it or not. Lately, I’ve been searching for video editor assistants. People who are organized, thoughtful, understand my voice, and create hi-fi social media content. I’m looking for someone who can help build the stringout, knows the project inside and out, and can jump in as a first editor if needed. Someone I trust to lay the foundation so I can do the cut and they can come in with the finishing touches. But here’s the thing… Out of 23 applicants I found on NOVA, only two were real options. One of them wasn’t based in a location that made sense for us to start working together. By the way, if you need an amazing assistant editor hit up David Kyle Anderson ^ though I’d like to gatekeep, he’s too good not to share. It’s not that the others weren’t talented. They just weren’t working in the style I needed. Most were focused on narrative or short film work, while I’m cutting hi-fi social content and events. That’s a completely different rhythm and language. And honestly, not many people do it well. So let this be your reminder, and a reminder to myself: Don’t count yourself out before you even shoot your shot. You never know who’s out there looking for exactly what you do best.","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] I started a freelancer community just a week ago. And what happened next was... shocking😑. 📍 Day 1: 50+ freelancers joined within hours. Great start. 📍 Day 2: We posted our first requirement a freelance video editor. We got 12 quick responses. Picked 3. Told the rest: “Hold on, more opportunities are coming.” 📍 Day 3: 8 freelancers messaged: “Any opening for sales/design/web?” I said, “Yes, we’ll post everything transparently when requirements come.” And just like that… 7 left the group immediately. Next day? 3 more. I wasn't surprised. But I did take note. Here’s what I realised (again): 👉 Many want to freelance, but very few want to build a career. 👉 They expect immediate jobs, instant money, and overnight results. 👉 If not, they leave thinking they’re saving time. Ironically, they’re just restarting the same loop elsewhere. But here’s the thing: ✅ Real communities don’t run on urgency they run on trust. ✅ Real clients don’t hire instantly they hire reliably. ✅ Real growth doesn’t happen overnight it happens consistently. I got my first client after 33 days of sitting in a silent office. No shortcuts. No luck. Just showing up, every day. So I’m not here to promise instant gigs or magic money. This community is for freelancers who: ✔️ Value quality over speed ✔️ Are ready to wait, learn, collaborate ✔️ Want real work, not random work If that’s you—you're welcome to join us: 👉 [https://lnkd.in/gTNwj24F) No hype.

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking for professional level video editor to hire! $50/hr Yes hello everyone! We’re looking for a professional-level video editor for longform (45–60 minute) political/historical content. If you have any issue with controversy, this won’t be a good fit for you. The style should be similar to what you’d see from outlets like Vox, Vice, or a Netflix documentary series — sleek motion graphics, archival overlays, stylized text, animated maps, and thoughtful sound design. Additionally, this is not a one-off project. We’re producing premium content behind a paywall with a major media network, and we need someone who can consistently help bring a polished, narrative-driven vision to life. You don’t necessarily need to have a sophisticated knowledge of the material itself, as you’ll be working closely with a director who will guide you on tone, timing, reference clips, and provide direction for the right assets and source materials. You should be proficient in Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut (DaVinci Resolve is a bonus), and capable of creating motion graphics in After Effects or similar. Experience working with stock footage, historical media, newspaper clippings, and animated typography is important. Strong editorial instincts and an understanding of visual pacing are critical. We need someone who knows how to keep an audience engaged without resorting to generic and recycled (AI-coded, if you will) presentations. We’re looking to start with about one video per month, with runtimes averaging 45 to 60 minutes. For the right person, this will be ongoing work with room to grow. Budget is flexible depending on experience and turnaround time, but you can expect at least industry standard. If you’re interested, please DM me a few samples of your work (YouTube links, reels, or full episode edits preferred), a short background on your experience, your typical turnaround time, and your rate expectations. You can also comment here and I’ll reach out. Thank you!","label":1}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking for professional level video editor to hire! $50/hr Yes hello everyone! We’re looking for a professional-level video editor for longform (45–60 minute) political/historical content. If you have any issue with controversy, this won’t be a good fit for you. The style should be similar to what you’d see from outlets like Vox, Vice, or a Netflix documentary series — sleek motion graphics, archival overlays, stylized text, animated maps, and thoughtful sound design. Additionally, this is not a one-off project. We’re producing premium content behind a paywall with a major media network, and we need someone who can consistently help bring a polished, narrative-driven vision to life. You don’t necessarily need to have a sophisticated knowledge of the material itself, as you’ll be working closely with a director who will guide you on tone, timing, reference clips, and provide direction for the right assets and source materials. You should be proficient in Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut (DaVinci Resolve is a bonus), and capable of creating motion graphics in After Effects or similar. Experience working with stock footage, historical media, newspaper clippings, and animated typography is important. Strong editorial instincts and an understanding of visual pacing are critical. We need someone who knows how to keep an audience engaged without resorting to generic and recycled (AI-coded, if you will) presentations. We’re looking to start with about one video per month, with runtimes averaging 45 to 60 minutes. For the right person, this will be ongoing work with room to grow. Budget is flexible depending on experience and turnaround time, but you can expect at least industry standard. If you’re interested, please DM me a few samples of your work (YouTube links, reels, or full episode edits preferred), a short background on your experience, your typical turnaround time, and your rate expectations. You can also comment here and I’ll reach out. Thank you!","label":1}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking for professional level video editor to hire! $50/hr Yes hello everyone! We’re looking for a professional-level video editor for longform (45–60 minute) political/historical content. If you have any issue with controversy, this won’t be a good fit for you. The style should be similar to what you’d see from outlets like Vox, Vice, or a Netflix documentary series — sleek motion graphics, archival overlays, stylized text, animated maps, and thoughtful sound design. Additionally, this is not a one-off project. We’re producing premium content behind a paywall with a major media network, and we need someone who can consistently help bring a polished, narrative-driven vision to life. You don’t necessarily need to have a sophisticated knowledge of the material itself, as you’ll be working closely with a director who will guide you on tone, timing, reference clips, and provide direction for the right assets and source materials. You should be proficient in Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut (DaVinci Resolve is a bonus), and capable of creating motion graphics in After Effects or similar. Experience working with stock footage, historical media, newspaper clippings, and animated typography is important. Strong editorial instincts and an understanding of visual pacing are critical. We need someone who knows how to keep an audience engaged without resorting to generic and recycled (AI-coded, if you will) presentations. We’re looking to start with about one video per month, with runtimes averaging 45 to 60 minutes. For the right person, this will be ongoing work with room to grow. Budget is flexible depending on experience and turnaround time, but you can expect at least industry standard. If you’re interested, please DM me a few samples of your work (YouTube links, reels, or full episode edits preferred), a short background on your experience, your typical turnaround time, and your rate expectations. You can also comment here and I’ll reach out. Thank you!","label":1}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking for professional level video editor to hire! $50/hr Yes hello everyone! We’re looking for a professional-level video editor for longform (45–60 minute) political/historical content. If you have any issue with controversy, this won’t be a good fit for you. The style should be similar to what you’d see from outlets like Vox, Vice, or a Netflix documentary series — sleek motion graphics, archival overlays, stylized text, animated maps, and thoughtful sound design. Additionally, this is not a one-off project. We’re producing premium content behind a paywall with a major media network, and we need someone who can consistently help bring a polished, narrative-driven vision to life. You don’t necessarily need to have a sophisticated knowledge of the material itself, as you’ll be working closely with a director who will guide you on tone, timing, reference clips, and provide direction for the right assets and source materials. You should be proficient in Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut (DaVinci Resolve is a bonus), and capable of creating motion graphics in After Effects or similar. Experience working with stock footage, historical media, newspaper clippings, and animated typography is important. Strong editorial instincts and an understanding of visual pacing are critical. We need someone who knows how to keep an audience engaged without resorting to generic and recycled (AI-coded, if you will) presentations. We’re looking to start with about one video per month, with runtimes averaging 45 to 60 minutes. For the right person, this will be ongoing work with room to grow. Budget is flexible depending on experience and turnaround time, but you can expect at least industry standard. If you’re interested, please DM me a few samples of your work (YouTube links, reels, or full episode edits preferred), a short background on your experience, your typical turnaround time, and your rate expectations. You can also comment here and I’ll reach out. Thank you!","label":1}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking for professional level video editor to hire! $50/hr Yes hello everyone! We’re looking for a professional-level video editor for longform (45–60 minute) political/historical content. If you have any issue with controversy, this won’t be a good fit for you. The style should be similar to what you’d see from outlets like Vox, Vice, or a Netflix documentary series — sleek motion graphics, archival overlays, stylized text, animated maps, and thoughtful sound design. Additionally, this is not a one-off project. We’re producing premium content behind a paywall with a major media network, and we need someone who can consistently help bring a polished, narrative-driven vision to life. You don’t necessarily need to have a sophisticated knowledge of the material itself, as you’ll be working closely with a director who will guide you on tone, timing, reference clips, and provide direction for the right assets and source materials. You should be proficient in Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut (DaVinci Resolve is a bonus), and capable of creating motion graphics in After Effects or similar. Experience working with stock footage, historical media, newspaper clippings, and animated typography is important. Strong editorial instincts and an understanding of visual pacing are critical. We need someone who knows how to keep an audience engaged without resorting to generic and recycled (AI-coded, if you will) presentations. We’re looking to start with about one video per month, with runtimes averaging 45 to 60 minutes. For the right person, this will be ongoing work with room to grow. Budget is flexible depending on experience and turnaround time, but you can expect at least industry standard. If you’re interested, please DM me a few samples of your work (YouTube links, reels, or full episode edits preferred), a short background on your experience, your typical turnaround time, and your rate expectations. You can also comment here and I’ll reach out. Thank you!","label":1}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking for a Video Editor to Join a Small YouTube Channel Project (Unpaid for Now, Future Profit Share) Hey everyone! I'm starting up a small YouTube channel and I'm on the lookout for a passionate video editor who’s interested in growing something from the ground up. Right now, this is a passion project—there’s no budget, so I can’t offer any payment up front. But the goal is to build a consistent content pipeline, start building a community, and eventually monetize the channel. When that happens, the editor will be the first person to benefit alongside me. This could be a great opportunity for someone looking to build their portfolio, experiment creatively, or be part of a growing team. I’ll handle the scripting, recording, and uploading—you’d help bring it all to life with editing flair. If you're into storytelling, pacing, humor, or even motion graphics, let’s talk! If you're interested, drop a comment or DM me with a bit about yourself and maybe a link to some of your work. Let’s build something cool together. Our channel is called The Boiz [https://www.youtube.com/@TheBoiz-z1m](https://www.youtube.com/@TheBoiz-z1m) I have tried to do it myself but with work and having very little knowledge about video editing it takes way to long for me to be able to do so.

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking for professional level video editor to hire! $50/hr Yes hello everyone! We’re looking for a professional-level video editor for longform (45–60 minute) political/historical content. If you have any issue with controversy, this won’t be a good fit for you. The style should be similar to what you’d see from outlets like Vox, Vice, or a Netflix documentary series — sleek motion graphics, archival overlays, stylized text, animated maps, and thoughtful sound design. Additionally, this is not a one-off project. We’re producing premium content behind a paywall with a major media network, and we need someone who can consistently help bring a polished, narrative-driven vision to life. You don’t necessarily need to have a sophisticated knowledge of the material itself, as you’ll be working closely with a director who will guide you on tone, timing, reference clips, and provide direction for the right assets and source materials. You should be proficient in Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut (DaVinci Resolve is a bonus), and capable of creating motion graphics in After Effects or similar. Experience working with stock footage, historical media, newspaper clippings, and animated typography is important. Strong editorial instincts and an understanding of visual pacing are critical. We need someone who knows how to keep an audience engaged without resorting to generic and recycled (AI-coded, if you will) presentations. We’re looking to start with about one video per month, with runtimes averaging 45 to 60 minutes. For the right person, this will be ongoing work with room to grow. Budget is flexible depending on experience and turnaround time, but you can expect at least industry standard. If you’re interested, please DM me a few samples of your work (YouTube links, reels, or full episode edits preferred), a short background on your experience, your typical turnaround time, and your rate expectations. You can also comment here and I’ll reach out. Thank you!","label":1}

We’re looking for a professional-level video editor for longform (45–60 minute) political/historical content. If you have any issue with controversy, this won’t be a good fit for you. The style should be similar to what you’d see from outlets like Vox, Vice, or a Netflix documentary series — sleek motion graphics, archival overlays, stylized text, animated maps, and thoughtful sound design. Additionally, this is not a one-off project. We’re producing premium content behind a paywall with a major media network, and we need someone who can consistently help bring a polished, narrative-driven vision to life. You don’t necessarily need to have a sophisticated knowledge of the material itself, as you’ll be working closely with a director who will guide you on tone, timing, reference clips, and provide direction for the right assets and source materials. You should be proficient in Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut (DaVinci Resolve is a bonus), and capable of creating motion graphics in After Effects or similar. Experience working with stock footage, historical media, newspaper clippings, and animated typography is important. Strong editorial instincts and an understanding of visual pacing are critical. We need someone who knows how to keep an audience engaged without resorting to generic and recycled (AI-coded, if you will) presentations. We’re looking to start with about one video per month, with runtimes averaging 45 to 60 minutes. For the right person, this will be ongoing work with room to grow. Budget is flexible depending on experience and turnaround time, but you can expect at least industry standard.

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking for professional level video editor to hire! $50/hr Yes hello everyone! We’re looking for a professional-level video editor for longform (45–60 minute) political/historical content. If you have any issue with controversy, this won’t be a good fit for you. The style should be similar to what you’d see from outlets like Vox, Vice, or a Netflix documentary series — sleek motion graphics, archival overlays, stylized text, animated maps, and thoughtful sound design. Additionally, this is not a one-off project. We’re producing premium content behind a paywall with a major media network, and we need someone who can consistently help bring a polished, narrative-driven vision to life. You don’t necessarily need to have a sophisticated knowledge of the material itself, as you’ll be working closely with a director who will guide you on tone, timing, reference clips, and provide direction for the right assets and source materials. You should be proficient in Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut (DaVinci Resolve is a bonus), and capable of creating motion graphics in After Effects or similar. Experience working with stock footage, historical media, newspaper clippings, and animated typography is important. Strong editorial instincts and an understanding of visual pacing are critical. We need someone who knows how to keep an audience engaged without resorting to generic and recycled (AI-coded, if you will) presentations. We’re looking to start with about one video per month, with runtimes averaging 45 to 60 minutes. For the right person, this will be ongoing work with room to grow. Budget is flexible depending on experience and turnaround time, but you can expect at least industry standard. If you’re interested, please DM me a few samples of your work (YouTube links, reels, or full episode edits preferred), a short background on your experience, your typical turnaround time, and your rate expectations. You can also comment here and I’ll reach out. Thank you!","label":1}
{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Hired a fresher with no experience. She had very little knowledge about the job role. But still I decided to give a chance to a Fresher. I had two options: ➤ A candidate with a polished portfolio and years of experience. ➤ A fresher with zero experience but unmissable spark in her eyes. I was hiring a video editor. Logically, I should’ve gone with the experienced one. But something inside me said— “Agar main chance nahi dungi, toh kaun dega?” She was determined to work hard and she was a quick learner. Over the past few weeks she proved herself. In just a few weeks, From learning editing basics. To now leading full video projects independently. From zero confidence. To now pitching creative concepts on her own. Last week, she edited a launch video that got 2x more traction than usual. It was her idea. Her execution. Her win. I don’t regret giving an opportunity to a fresher. My decision of hiring her for my company was very right. 🎯 To all recruiters and hiring managers: Experience matters, yes. But intent can take people farther. Just give one fresher a chance. They might just surprise you. Recruiters should always give a chance to freshers and shouldn’t always look for work experience. 💡 To all freshers out there: Nobody owes you a job. But if you get an opportunity - OWN IT. Ask questions. Work harder than everyone else. Build trust, not excuses. Because one opportunity can change everything.

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking for professional level video editor to hire! $50/hr Yes hello everyone! We’re looking for a professional-level video editor for longform (45–60 minute) political/historical content. If you have any issue with controversy, this won’t be a good fit for you. The style should be similar to what you’d see from outlets like Vox, Vice, or a Netflix documentary series — sleek motion graphics, archival overlays, stylized text, animated maps, and thoughtful sound design. Additionally, this is not a one-off project. We’re producing premium content behind a paywall with a major media network, and we need someone who can consistently help bring a polished, narrative-driven vision to life. You don’t necessarily need to have a sophisticated knowledge of the material itself, as you’ll be working closely with a director who will guide you on tone, timing, reference clips, and provide direction for the right assets and source materials. You should be proficient in Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut (DaVinci Resolve is a bonus), and capable of creating motion graphics in After Effects or similar. Experience working with stock footage, historical media, newspaper clippings, and animated typography is important. Strong editorial instincts and an understanding of visual pacing are critical. We need someone who knows how to keep an audience engaged without resorting to generic and recycled (AI-coded, if you will) presentations. We’re looking to start with about one video per month, with runtimes averaging 45 to 60 minutes. For the right person, this will be ongoing work with room to grow. Budget is flexible depending on experience and turnaround time, but you can expect at least industry standard. If you’re interested, please DM me a few samples of your work (YouTube links, reels, or full episode edits preferred), a short background on your experience, your typical turnaround time, and your rate expectations. You can also comment here and I’ll reach out. Thank you!","label":1}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] I have fired 2 people in my team this month, and it was a good decision. Now I have a team of 7 people, and they have helped me reach $300K ARR. Initially, I used to think I needed 20 people to handle everything in my agency, but that wasn’t correct. I don’t need this many people, and I sure as hell don’t need to manage so much. It was getting chaotic, and I was burned out. 7-8 meetings every day, so much back and forth. It was a mess. Obviously they didn’t see it, but I could. Did I need 3 editors in my team to review the content? No. Just needed 2 great ones. Did I need an operations head to take care of things on top? No. I could do that much faster. The smaller my team is, the faster the work gets done. And I can take the weekend off, which I have not taken in years. I know that I can't do all the roles myself. I can't be the marketer, the writer, the editor, and ops head, or the director. I know I need people to take care of so much stuff. But I also know that hiring great people is the key. Not good or better. But great. I wanna delegate stuff to the people who can do it better than me, who can do it faster than me. If you are one, I am hiring such people.

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking for professional level video editor to hire! $50/hr Yes hello everyone! We’re looking for a professional-level video editor for longform (45–60 minute) political/historical content. If you have any issue with controversy, this won’t be a good fit for you. The style should be similar to what you’d see from outlets like Vox, Vice, or a Netflix documentary series — sleek motion graphics, archival overlays, stylized text, animated maps, and thoughtful sound design. Additionally, this is not a one-off project. We’re producing premium content behind a paywall with a major media network, and we need someone who can consistently help bring a polished, narrative-driven vision to life. You don’t necessarily need to have a sophisticated knowledge of the material itself, as you’ll be working closely with a director who will guide you on tone, timing, reference clips, and provide direction for the right assets and source materials. You should be proficient in Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut (DaVinci Resolve is a bonus), and capable of creating motion graphics in After Effects or similar. Experience working with stock footage, historical media, newspaper clippings, and animated typography is important. Strong editorial instincts and an understanding of visual pacing are critical. We need someone who knows how to keep an audience engaged without resorting to generic and recycled (AI-coded, if you will) presentations. We’re looking to start with about one video per month, with runtimes averaging 45 to 60 minutes. For the right person, this will be ongoing work with room to grow. Budget is flexible depending on experience and turnaround time, but you can expect at least industry standard. If you’re interested, please DM me a few samples of your work (YouTube links, reels, or full episode edits preferred), a short background on your experience, your typical turnaround time, and your rate expectations. You can also comment here and I’ll reach out. Thank you!","label":1}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking for professional level video editor to hire! $50/hr Yes hello everyone! We’re looking for a professional-level video editor for longform (45–60 minute) political/historical content. If you have any issue with controversy, this won’t be a good fit for you. The style should be similar to what you’d see from outlets like Vox, Vice, or a Netflix documentary series — sleek motion graphics, archival overlays, stylized text, animated maps, and thoughtful sound design. Additionally, this is not a one-off project. We’re producing premium content behind a paywall with a major media network, and we need someone who can consistently help bring a polished, narrative-driven vision to life. You don’t necessarily need to have a sophisticated knowledge of the material itself, as you’ll be working closely with a director who will guide you on tone, timing, reference clips, and provide direction for the right assets and source materials. You should be proficient in Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut (DaVinci Resolve is a bonus), and capable of creating motion graphics in After Effects or similar. Experience working with stock footage, historical media, newspaper clippings, and animated typography is important. Strong editorial instincts and an understanding of visual pacing are critical. We need someone who knows how to keep an audience engaged without resorting to generic and recycled (AI-coded, if you will) presentations. We’re looking to start with about one video per month, with runtimes averaging 45 to 60 minutes. For the right person, this will be ongoing work with room to grow. Budget is flexible depending on experience and turnaround time, but you can expect at least industry standard. If you’re interested, please DM me a few samples of your work (YouTube links, reels, or full episode edits preferred), a short background on your experience, your typical turnaround time, and your rate expectations. You can also comment here and I’ll reach out. Thank you!","label":1}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking for professional level video editor to hire! $50/hr Yes hello everyone! We’re looking for a professional-level video editor for longform (45–60 minute) political/historical content. If you have any issue with controversy, this won’t be a good fit for you. The style should be similar to what you’d see from outlets like Vox, Vice, or a Netflix documentary series — sleek motion graphics, archival overlays, stylized text, animated maps, and thoughtful sound design. Additionally, this is not a one-off project. We’re producing premium content behind a paywall with a major media network, and we need someone who can consistently help bring a polished, narrative-driven vision to life. You don’t necessarily need to have a sophisticated knowledge of the material itself, as you’ll be working closely with a director who will guide you on tone, timing, reference clips, and provide direction for the right assets and source materials. You should be proficient in Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut (DaVinci Resolve is a bonus), and capable of creating motion graphics in After Effects or similar. Experience working with stock footage, historical media, newspaper clippings, and animated typography is important. Strong editorial instincts and an understanding of visual pacing are critical. We need someone who knows how to keep an audience engaged without resorting to generic and recycled (AI-coded, if you will) presentations. We’re looking to start with about one video per month, with runtimes averaging 45 to 60 minutes. For the right person, this will be ongoing work with room to grow. Budget is flexible depending on experience and turnaround time, but you can expect at least industry standard. If you’re interested, please DM me a few samples of your work (YouTube links, reels, or full episode edits preferred), a short background on your experience, your typical turnaround time, and your rate expectations. You can also comment here and I’ll reach out. Thank you!","label":1}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking for professional level video editor to hire! $50/hr Yes hello everyone! We’re looking for a professional-level video editor for longform (45–60 minute) political/historical content. If you have any issue with controversy, this won’t be a good fit for you. The style should be similar to what you’d see from outlets like Vox, Vice, or a Netflix documentary series — sleek motion graphics, archival overlays, stylized text, animated maps, and thoughtful sound design. Additionally, this is not a one-off project. We’re producing premium content behind a paywall with a major media network, and we need someone who can consistently help bring a polished, narrative-driven vision to life. You don’t necessarily need to have a sophisticated knowledge of the material itself, as you’ll be working closely with a director who will guide you on tone, timing, reference clips, and provide direction for the right assets and source materials. You should be proficient in Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut (DaVinci Resolve is a bonus), and capable of creating motion graphics in After Effects or similar. Experience working with stock footage, historical media, newspaper clippings, and animated typography is important. Strong editorial instincts and an understanding of visual pacing are critical. We need someone who knows how to keep an audience engaged without resorting to generic and recycled (AI-coded, if you will) presentations. We’re looking to start with about one video per month, with runtimes averaging 45 to 60 minutes. For the right person, this will be ongoing work with room to grow. Budget is flexible depending on experience and turnaround time, but you can expect at least industry standard. If you’re interested, please DM me a few samples of your work (YouTube links, reels, or full episode edits preferred), a short background on your experience, your typical turnaround time, and your rate expectations.

We’re looking for a professional-level video editor for longform (45–60 minute) political/historical content. If you have any issue with controversy, this won’t be a good fit for you. The style should be similar to what you’d see from outlets like Vox, Vice, or a Netflix documentary series — sleek motion graphics, archival overlays, stylized text, animated maps, and thoughtful sound design. Additionally, this is not a one-off project. We’re producing premium content behind a paywall with a major media network, and we need someone who can consistently help bring a polished, narrative-driven vision to life. You don’t necessarily need to have a sophisticated knowledge of the material itself, as you’ll be working closely with a director who will guide you on tone, timing, reference clips, and provide direction for the right assets and source materials. You should be proficient in Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut (DaVinci Resolve is a bonus), and capable of creating motion graphics in After Effects or similar. Experience working with stock footage, historical media, newspaper clippings, and animated typography is important. Strong editorial instincts and an understanding of visual pacing are critical. We need someone who knows how to keep an audience engaged without resorting to generic and recycled (AI-coded, if you will) presentations. We’re looking to start with about one video per month, with runtimes averaging 45 to 60 minutes. For the right person, this will be ongoing work with room to grow. Budget is flexible depending on experience and turnaround time, but you can expect at least industry standard.

Experience working with stock footage, historical media, newspaper clippings, and animated typography is important. Strong editorial instincts and an understanding of visual pacing are critical. We need someone who knows how to keep an audience engaged without resorting to generic and recycled (AI-coded, if you will) presentations. We’re looking to start with about one video per month, with runtimes averaging 45 to 60 minutes. For the right person, this will be ongoing work with room to grow. Budget is flexible depending on experience and turnaround time, but you can expect at least industry standard. If you’re interested, please DM me a few samples of your work (YouTube links, reels, or full episode edits preferred), a short background on your experience, your typical turnaround time, and your rate expectations. You can also comment here and I’ll reach out. Thank you!","label":1}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking for a Video Editor to Join a Small YouTube Channel Project (Unpaid for Now, Future Profit Share) Hey everyone! I'm starting up a small YouTube channel and I'm on the lookout for a passionate video editor who’s interested in growing something from the ground up. Right now, this is a passion project—there’s no budget, so I can’t offer any payment up front. But the goal is to build a consistent content pipeline, start building a community, and eventually monetize the channel. When that happens, the editor will be the first person to benefit alongside me. This could be a great opportunity for someone looking to build their portfolio, experiment creatively, or be part of a growing team. I’ll handle the scripting, recording, and uploading—you’d help bring it all to life with editing flair. If you're into storytelling, pacing, humor, or even motion graphics, let’s talk! If you're interested, drop a comment or DM me with a bit about yourself and maybe a link to some of your work. Let’s build something cool together.

{"text":"[REDDIT] [Hiring] URGENT: Ambitious 'Saving Democracy for Dummies' Video - 4 Progressive Activist Creatives Needed - To Launch July 4th **Mission Statement:** The People are America’s “Hail Mary”, we’re the coaches, and this is their playbook. We're in a constitutional crisis, but the simple solution is everyday individuals changing their habits; the main reason they don’t? - information overload, political exhaustion, and escapism. This project aims to provide everyone with what's been missing; to meet them exactly where they're at, and give them exactly what they need, without scaring them off, but re-igniting them instead. By presenting the easiest tools, providing fool-proof instructions, and illustrating their urgent necessity, this video will make saving democracy feel like a no brainer. The choir is going to love our preaching either way - this is about reaching the exhausted, the overwhelmed, and the checked-out, with tools so simple they can't ignore them. Without this playbook, we won't escape this crisis - we'll only make our struggles worse and give up democracy while pointing fingers and clinging to complacency. Screw that. **Timeline:** Immediate start, structured 2-week sprint + weekends; aim to publish on July 4^(th) (Independence Day); completing one 3-minute chapter a day, with days to spare for extra care on the video introduction.

Human-crafted quality that leverages AI tools effectively. **Digital Strategist:** Social media and video content expert able to strategize maximizing reach and engagement, to gain viral momentum across multiple platforms.

This project aims to provide everyone with what's been missing; to meet them exactly where they're at, and give them exactly what they need, without scaring them off, but re-igniting them instead. By presenting the easiest tools, providing fool-proof instructions, and illustrating their urgent necessity, this video will make saving democracy feel like a no brainer. The choir is going to love our preaching either way - this is about reaching the exhausted, the overwhelmed, and the checked-out, with tools so simple they can't ignore them. Without this playbook, we won't escape this crisis - we'll only make our struggles worse and give up democracy while pointing fingers and clinging to complacency.

{"text":"[REDDIT] [Hiring] URGENT: Ambitious 'Saving Democracy for Dummies' Video - 4 Progressive Activist Creatives Needed - To Launch July 4th **Mission Statement:** The People are America’s “Hail Mary”, we’re the coaches, and this is their playbook. We're in a constitutional crisis, but the simple solution is everyday individuals changing their habits; the main reason they don’t? - information overload, political exhaustion, and escapism. This project aims to provide everyone with what's been missing; to meet them exactly where they're at, and give them exactly what they need, without scaring them off, but re-igniting them instead. By presenting the easiest tools, providing fool-proof instructions, and illustrating their urgent necessity, this video will make saving democracy feel like a no brainer. The choir is going to love our preaching either way - this is about reaching the exhausted, the overwhelmed, and the checked-out, with tools so simple they can't ignore them. Without this playbook, we won't escape this crisis - we'll only make our struggles worse and give up democracy while pointing fingers and clinging to complacency. Screw that. **Timeline:** Immediate start, structured 2-week sprint + weekends; aim to publish on July 4^(th) (Independence Day); completing one 3-minute chapter a day, with days to spare for extra care on the video introduction. No specific order. Each day, an already written chapter is edited and prepped for posting, while the next chapter is written and researched. I’ve already written two chapters that are ready for editing and posting prep. We gotta work hard because democracy can’t wait, but we’re human, so I know clear goals and time management are necessary to stay efficient and motivated. **Working Style:** Direct collaboration with team and project creator, mission-driven, thorough, and AI-friendly but with caution. Discord for comms, Miro for whiteboarding. Each role has a checklist for each chapter. Parallel development. We're building this together - every voice matters in shaping how we wake people up without adding to the burn out. **Compensation:** Modest upfront payments (40% on start, 60% on final video publish) + Revenue Sharing for 18 months (ad rev, affiliate links, through 2026 midterms) +10% bonus if successfully launched July 4^(th). Total upfront budget for all roles is $2k. I may have the vision, doesn’t mean I have the wealth, but this is too big to let it stop me. **Content Vision:** An \"Everyman's Handbook to Save Democracy\" video. Compelling intro. Nine chapters, each less than 3 minutes long. Each chapter presents a different democratic problem, and connects it to viewer’s actions/inaction, but aims to validate exhaustion, clearly establish the stakes, and gently galvanize into following 7 simple steps for using easy civic engagement apps, tools, or methods. With supporting visuals. Ambitiously and strategically posted to maximize reach, engagement, and momentum on July 4th, to best ensure mass participation. **Outline:** Official Titles TBA. Part 1: \"From the Couch\" * Chapter 1. \"Combat Internet Propaganda\" * Chapter 2. \"Fund & Pressure Election Protection\" * Chapter 3. \"Stop Paying Oligarchs\" Part 2: “Working Together” * Chapter 4. \"Volunteer en masse\" * Chapter 5. \"Support/use mutual aid\" * Chapter 6. \"Don't just march, disrupt\" Part 3: “Taking Charge” * Chapter 7. \"Run for office en masse\" * Chapter 8. \"Make innovative tools\" * Chapter 9. \"Enforce the Constitution\" # Roles Needed: **Script Writer:** Persuasive speech writer, able to collaborate on optimizing a video script that follows a formula. Each chapter uses Monroe's Motivated Sequence with ethical persuasion to achieve maximum participation in 7-step instructions for using a given tool/method. Target audience is primarily the apathetic and overwhelmed, secondarily the progressive public. Writing style is: Eye-opening, Authentic, and Gently-Galvanizing - making political action feel effortless yet urgent, inspiring even the complacent. Human-crafted quality but allowed to leverage AI tools effectively. **Researcher & UX Tester:** Diligent tool finder and tester, to find the civic engagement tool or method with the highest impact on a problem for the lowest cognitive effort. The goal is to find the one tool that actually makes a difference, and that lazy/busy people will actually use, not just the one that looks good on paper. Evaluate a tool’s practical outcome on the problem and approach each tool from the shoes of the overwhelmed and apathetic, to immediately sense when they’ll give up using a tool (i.e. walls of text, menu navigation, button searching, setting configuration, etc.) Additionally, able to find the most credible sources to support script claims, with a hierarchy of evidence understanding, and provide to editor for displaying citations. Well-practiced with using AI to support their efforts. **Video & Graphics Editor:** Add minimalist graphics, clips, and text to visually support democracy and civic engagement explanations, persuasive points, and step-by-step instructions. Responsibilities include sourcing supporting b-roll, designing chapter transition screens, and adding emphasizer captions. Also, to adapt video chapters into separate short-form videos. Human-crafted quality that leverages AI tools effectively. **Digital Strategist:** Social media and video content expert able to strategize maximizing reach and engagement, to gain viral momentum across multiple platforms. Optimize SEO, thumbnail click-rates, posting schedules, and acquire big-name reactions and exposure. Prevent platform backlash and coordinated attacks while building organic viral potential.","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] [Hiring] URGENT: Ambitious 'Saving Democracy for Dummies' Video - 4 Progressive Activist Creatives Needed - To Launch July 4th **Mission Statement:** The People are America’s “Hail Mary”, we’re the coaches, and this is their playbook. We're in a constitutional crisis, but the simple solution is everyday individuals changing their habits; the main reason they don’t? - information overload, political exhaustion, and escapism. This project aims to provide everyone with what's been missing; to meet them exactly where they're at, and give them exactly what they need, without scaring them off, but re-igniting them instead. By presenting the easiest tools, providing fool-proof instructions, and illustrating their urgent necessity, this video will make saving democracy feel like a no brainer. The choir is going to love our preaching either way - this is about reaching the exhausted, the overwhelmed, and the checked-out, with tools so simple they can't ignore them. Without this playbook, we won't escape this crisis - we'll only make our struggles worse and give up democracy while pointing fingers and clinging to complacency. Screw that. **Timeline:** Immediate start, structured 2-week sprint + weekends; aim to publish on July 4^(th) (Independence Day); completing one 3-minute chapter a day, with days to spare for extra care on the video introduction. No specific order. Each day, an already written chapter is edited and prepped for posting, while the next chapter is written and researched. I’ve already written two chapters that are ready for editing and posting prep. We gotta work hard because democracy can’t wait, but we’re human, so I know clear goals and time management are necessary to stay efficient and motivated. **Working Style:** Direct collaboration with team and project creator, mission-driven, thorough, and AI-friendly but with caution. Discord for comms, Miro for whiteboarding. Each role has a checklist for each chapter. Parallel development. We're building this together - every voice matters in shaping how we wake people up without adding to the burn out. **Compensation:** Modest upfront payments (40% on start, 60% on final video publish) + Revenue Sharing for 18 months (ad rev, affiliate links, through 2026 midterms) +10% bonus if successfully launched July 4^(th). Total upfront budget for all roles is $2k. I may have the vision, doesn’t mean I have the wealth, but this is too big to let it stop me. **Content Vision:** An \"Everyman's Handbook to Save Democracy\" video. Compelling intro. Nine chapters, each less than 3 minutes long. Each chapter presents a different democratic problem, and connects it to viewer’s actions/inaction, but aims to validate exhaustion, clearly establish the stakes, and gently galvanize into following 7 simple steps for using easy civic engagement apps, tools, or methods. With supporting visuals. Ambitiously and strategically posted to maximize reach, engagement, and momentum on July 4th, to best ensure mass participation. **Outline:** Official Titles TBA. Part 1: \"From the Couch\" * Chapter 1. \"Combat Internet Propaganda\" * Chapter 2. \"Fund & Pressure Election Protection\" * Chapter 3. \"Stop Paying Oligarchs\" Part 2: “Working Together” * Chapter 4. \"Volunteer en masse\" * Chapter 5. \"Support/use mutual aid\" * Chapter 6. \"Don't just march, disrupt\" Part 3: “Taking Charge” * Chapter 7. \"Run for office en masse\" * Chapter 8. \"Make innovative tools\" * Chapter 9. \"Enforce the Constitution\" # Roles Needed: **Script Writer:** Persuasive speech writer, able to collaborate on optimizing a video script that follows a formula. Each chapter uses Monroe's Motivated Sequence with ethical persuasion to achieve maximum participation in 7-step instructions for using a given tool/method. Target audience is primarily the apathetic and overwhelmed, secondarily the progressive public. Writing style is: Eye-opening, Authentic, and Gently-Galvanizing - making political action feel effortless yet urgent, inspiring even the complacent. Human-crafted quality but allowed to leverage AI tools effectively. **Researcher & UX Tester:** Diligent tool finder and tester, to find the civic engagement tool or method with the highest impact on a problem for the lowest cognitive effort. The goal is to find the one tool that actually makes a difference, and that lazy/busy people will actually use, not just the one that looks good on paper. Evaluate a tool’s practical outcome on the problem and approach each tool from the shoes of the overwhelmed and apathetic, to immediately sense when they’ll give up using a tool (i.e. walls of text, menu navigation, button searching, setting configuration, etc.) Additionally, able to find the most credible sources to support script claims, with a hierarchy of evidence understanding, and provide to editor for displaying citations. Well-practiced with using AI to support their efforts. **Video & Graphics Editor:** Add minimalist graphics, clips, and text to visually support democracy and civic engagement explanations, persuasive points, and step-by-step instructions. Responsibilities include sourcing supporting b-roll, designing chapter transition screens, and adding emphasizer captions. Also, to adapt video chapters into separate short-form videos. Human-crafted quality that leverages AI tools effectively. **Digital Strategist:** Social media and video content expert able to strategize maximizing reach and engagement, to gain viral momentum across multiple platforms. Optimize SEO, thumbnail click-rates, posting schedules, and acquire big-name reactions and exposure. Prevent platform backlash and coordinated attacks while building organic viral potential.","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] [Hiring] URGENT: Ambitious 'Saving Democracy for Dummies' Video - 4 Progressive Activist Creatives Needed - To Launch July 4th **Mission Statement:** The People are America’s “Hail Mary”, we’re the coaches, and this is their playbook. We're in a constitutional crisis, but the simple solution is everyday individuals changing their habits; the main reason they don’t? - information overload, political exhaustion, and escapism. This project aims to provide everyone with what's been missing; to meet them exactly where they're at, and give them exactly what they need, without scaring them off, but re-igniting them instead. By presenting the easiest tools, providing fool-proof instructions, and illustrating their urgent necessity, this video will make saving democracy feel like a no brainer. The choir is going to love our preaching either way - this is about reaching the exhausted, the overwhelmed, and the checked-out, with tools so simple they can't ignore them. Without this playbook, we won't escape this crisis - we'll only make our struggles worse and give up democracy while pointing fingers and clinging to complacency. Screw that. **Timeline:** Immediate start, structured 2-week sprint + weekends; aim to publish on July 4^(th) (Independence Day); completing one 3-minute chapter a day, with days to spare for extra care on the video introduction. No specific order. Each day, an already written chapter is edited and prepped for posting, while the next chapter is written and researched. I’ve already written two chapters that are ready for editing and posting prep.

{"text":"[REDDIT] [Hiring] URGENT: Ambitious 'Saving Democracy for Dummies' Video - 4 Progressive Activist Creatives Needed - To Launch July 4th **Mission Statement:** The People are America’s “Hail Mary”, we’re the coaches, and this is their playbook. We're in a constitutional crisis, but the simple solution is everyday individuals changing their habits; the main reason they don’t? - information overload, political exhaustion, and escapism. This project aims to provide everyone with what's been missing; to meet them exactly where they're at, and give them exactly what they need, without scaring them off, but re-igniting them instead. By presenting the easiest tools, providing fool-proof instructions, and illustrating their urgent necessity, this video will make saving democracy feel like a no brainer. The choir is going to love our preaching either way - this is about reaching the exhausted, the overwhelmed, and the checked-out, with tools so simple they can't ignore them. Without this playbook, we won't escape this crisis - we'll only make our struggles worse and give up democracy while pointing fingers and clinging to complacency. Screw that. **Timeline:** Immediate start, structured 2-week sprint + weekends; aim to publish on July 4^(th) (Independence Day); completing one 3-minute chapter a day, with days to spare for extra care on the video introduction. No specific order. Each day, an already written chapter is edited and prepped for posting, while the next chapter is written and researched. I’ve already written two chapters that are ready for editing and posting prep. We gotta work hard because democracy can’t wait, but we’re human, so I know clear goals and time management are necessary to stay efficient and motivated. **Working Style:** Direct collaboration with team and project creator, mission-driven, thorough, and AI-friendly but with caution. Discord for comms, Miro for whiteboarding. Each role has a checklist for each chapter. Parallel development. We're building this together - every voice matters in shaping how we wake people up without adding to the burn out. **Compensation:** Modest upfront payments (40% on start, 60% on final video publish) + Revenue Sharing for 18 months (ad rev, affiliate links, through 2026 midterms) +10% bonus if successfully launched July 4^(th). Total upfront budget for all roles is $2k. I may have the vision, doesn’t mean I have the wealth, but this is too big to let it stop me. **Content Vision:** An \"Everyman's Handbook to Save Democracy\" video. Compelling intro. Nine chapters, each less than 3 minutes long. Each chapter presents a different democratic problem, and connects it to viewer’s actions/inaction, but aims to validate exhaustion, clearly establish the stakes, and gently galvanize into following 7 simple steps for using easy civic engagement apps, tools, or methods. With supporting visuals. Ambitiously and strategically posted to maximize reach, engagement, and momentum on July 4th, to best ensure mass participation. **Outline:** Official Titles TBA. Part 1: \"From the Couch\" * Chapter 1. \"Combat Internet Propaganda\" * Chapter 2. \"Fund & Pressure Election Protection\" * Chapter 3. \"Stop Paying Oligarchs\" Part 2: “Working Together” * Chapter 4. \"Volunteer en masse\" * Chapter 5. \"Support/use mutual aid\" * Chapter 6. \"Don't just march, disrupt\" Part 3: “Taking Charge” * Chapter 7. \"Run for office en masse\" * Chapter 8. \"Make innovative tools\" * Chapter 9. \"Enforce the Constitution\" # Roles Needed: **Script Writer:** Persuasive speech writer, able to collaborate on optimizing a video script that follows a formula. Each chapter uses Monroe's Motivated Sequence with ethical persuasion to achieve maximum participation in 7-step instructions for using a given tool/method. Target audience is primarily the apathetic and overwhelmed, secondarily the progressive public. Writing style is: Eye-opening, Authentic, and Gently-Galvanizing - making political action feel effortless yet urgent, inspiring even the complacent. Human-crafted quality but allowed to leverage AI tools effectively. **Researcher & UX Tester:** Diligent tool finder and tester, to find the civic engagement tool or method with the highest impact on a problem for the lowest cognitive effort. The goal is to find the one tool that actually makes a difference, and that lazy/busy people will actually use, not just the one that looks good on paper. Evaluate a tool’s practical outcome on the problem and approach each tool from the shoes of the overwhelmed and apathetic, to immediately sense when they’ll give up using a tool (i.e. walls of text, menu navigation, button searching, setting configuration, etc.) Additionally, able to find the most credible sources to support script claims, with a hierarchy of evidence understanding, and provide to editor for displaying citations. Well-practiced with using AI to support their efforts. **Video & Graphics Editor:** Add minimalist graphics, clips, and text to visually support democracy and civic engagement explanations, persuasive points, and step-by-step instructions. Responsibilities include sourcing supporting b-roll, designing chapter transition screens, and adding emphasizer captions. Also, to adapt video chapters into separate short-form videos. Human-crafted quality that leverages AI tools effectively. **Digital Strategist:** Social media and video content expert able to strategize maximizing reach and engagement, to gain viral momentum across multiple platforms. Optimize SEO, thumbnail click-rates, posting schedules, and acquire big-name reactions and exposure. Prevent platform backlash and coordinated attacks while building organic viral potential.","label":1}

{"text":"[REDDIT] [Hiring] URGENT: Ambitious 'Saving Democracy for Dummies' Video - 4 Progressive Activist Creatives Needed - To Launch July 4th **Mission Statement:** The People are America’s “Hail Mary”, we’re the coaches, and this is their playbook. We're in a constitutional crisis, but the simple solution is everyday individuals changing their habits; the main reason they don’t? - information overload, political exhaustion, and escapism. This project aims to provide everyone with what's been missing; to meet them exactly where they're at, and give them exactly what they need, without scaring them off, but re-igniting them instead. By presenting the easiest tools, providing fool-proof instructions, and illustrating their urgent necessity, this video will make saving democracy feel like a no brainer. The choir is going to love our preaching either way - this is about reaching the exhausted, the overwhelmed, and the checked-out, with tools so simple they can't ignore them. Without this playbook, we won't escape this crisis - we'll only make our struggles worse and give up democracy while pointing fingers and clinging to complacency. Screw that. **Timeline:** Immediate start, structured 2-week sprint + weekends; aim to publish on July 4^(th) (Independence Day); completing one 3-minute chapter a day, with days to spare for extra care on the video introduction. No specific order. Each day, an already written chapter is edited and prepped for posting, while the next chapter is written and researched. I’ve already written two chapters that are ready for editing and posting prep. We gotta work hard because democracy can’t wait, but we’re human, so I know clear goals and time management are necessary to stay efficient and motivated. **Working Style:** Direct collaboration with team and project creator, mission-driven, thorough, and AI-friendly but with caution. Discord for comms, Miro for whiteboarding. Each role has a checklist for each chapter. Parallel development. We're building this together - every voice matters in shaping how we wake people up without adding to the burn out. **Compensation:** Modest upfront payments (40% on start, 60% on final video publish) + Revenue Sharing for 18 months (ad rev, affiliate links, through 2026 midterms) +10% bonus if successfully launched July 4^(th). Total upfront budget for all roles is $2k. I may have the vision, doesn’t mean I have the wealth, but this is too big to let it stop me. **Content Vision:** An \"Everyman's Handbook to Save Democracy\" video. Compelling intro. Nine chapters, each less than 3 minutes long. Each chapter presents a different democratic problem, and connects it to viewer’s actions/inaction, but aims to validate exhaustion, clearly establish the stakes, and gently galvanize into following 7 simple steps for using easy civic engagement apps, tools, or methods. With supporting visuals. Ambitiously and strategically posted to maximize reach, engagement, and momentum on July 4th, to best ensure mass participation. **Outline:** Official Titles TBA. Part 1: \"From the Couch\" * Chapter 1. \"Combat Internet Propaganda\" * Chapter 2. \"Fund & Pressure Election Protection\" * Chapter 3. \"Stop Paying Oligarchs\" Part 2: “Working Together” * Chapter 4. \"Volunteer en masse\" * Chapter 5. \"Support/use mutual aid\" * Chapter 6. \"Don't just march, disrupt\" Part 3: “Taking Charge” * Chapter 7. \"Run for office en masse\" * Chapter 8. \"Make innovative tools\" * Chapter 9. \"Enforce the Constitution\" # Roles Needed: **Script Writer:** Persuasive speech writer, able to collaborate on optimizing a video script that follows a formula. Each chapter uses Monroe's Motivated Sequence with ethical persuasion to achieve maximum participation in 7-step instructions for using a given tool/method. Target audience is primarily the apathetic and overwhelmed, secondarily the progressive public. Writing style is: Eye-opening, Authentic, and Gently-Galvanizing - making political action feel effortless yet urgent, inspiring even the complacent. Human-crafted quality but allowed to leverage AI tools effectively. **Researcher & UX Tester:** Diligent tool finder and tester, to find the civic engagement tool or method with the highest impact on a problem for the lowest cognitive effort. The goal is to find the one tool that actually makes a difference, and that lazy/busy people will actually use, not just the one that looks good on paper. Evaluate a tool’s practical outcome on the problem and approach each tool from the shoes of the overwhelmed and apathetic, to immediately sense when they’ll give up using a tool (i.e. walls of text, menu navigation, button searching, setting configuration, etc.) Additionally, able to find the most credible sources to support script claims, with a hierarchy of evidence understanding, and provide to editor for displaying citations. Well-practiced with using AI to support their efforts. **Video & Graphics Editor:** Add minimalist graphics, clips, and text to visually support democracy and civic engagement explanations, persuasive points, and step-by-step instructions. Responsibilities include sourcing supporting b-roll, designing chapter transition screens, and adding emphasizer captions. Also, to adapt video chapters into separate short-form videos. Human-crafted quality that leverages AI tools effectively. **Digital Strategist:** Social media and video content expert able to strategize maximizing reach and engagement, to gain viral momentum across multiple platforms. Optimize SEO, thumbnail click-rates, posting schedules, and acquire big-name reactions and exposure. Prevent platform backlash and coordinated attacks while building organic viral potential.","label":0}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] Just back from VidCon 2025 -- here are 4 takeaways & tips you can apply to content creation right now: Looking to hire a video editor? Do paid trials before hiring. Yes, it takes more time, but it's the best way to test for quality, speed, communication, and creative alignment. It saves headaches later. Researching a new niche? Start a fresh social account and train the algorithm to only show you content in that niche. You'll get a more authentic view of the ecosystem — not just the viral stuff, but the content real fans are actually engaging with. BlueSky is launching monetization + subscriptions. That was my cue to finally claim my account. It’s giving early Twitter energy, and it could be a great space to connect with your community before it gets saturated. Creating for YouTube? Know where your audience is watching. If your audience is 25+ and likely to own a TV, they’re probably watching YouTube on their TVs. That means they want longer content (20+ minutes)... something they can sit back and enjoy without clicking away.","label":1}

{"text":"[LINKEDIN] 🏘️ Did you know the real estate industry is one of the biggest buyers of high-quality video content today? Many people think video editing jobs are limited to films, YouTube, or ad agencies — but real estate has quietly become a goldmine for skilled video editors. In this video, I talk about how real estate companies are now fully invested in digital marketing, and how they rely heavily on visual content to sell properties, build brands, and connect with clients. 📹 Here are just a few types of videos realtors need regularly: ✅ Property walkthroughs (virtual tours) ✅ Drone shots of large properties and neighborhoods ✅ Testimonial videos from buyers ✅ Lifestyle-focused promos (to sell not just the home, but the dream) ✅ Instagram Reels and short ads for social media ✅ Project updates and behind-the-scenes content for builders 💼 This industry is actively hiring or outsourcing editors who can deliver clean, compelling, and emotionally engaging videos.

{"text":"[REDDIT] Where to get music for videos posted on social media? Hello! I am a semi professional photographer and a video editor who is just starting to get his first clients. I have a question, which has probably been asked before, but I have googled it and found conflicting information, so I am asking here. I shoot at events for local fire stations, tourist agencies and so on. I make reels and around 3 - 7 minute videos of their events, which they then post to their social media, mostly not monetising the videos. I am now having problems with finding music for the videos. Since different agencies post videos to different social media, I am scared that the videos will get copyrighted. If I use music from the Youtube library, I am scared that the reel will get muted on Instagram. If I use music from Meta library, I am worrying that it will get copyrighted on Youtube. Since I am not posting the videos, it is also difficult to tell all my clients that they need to credit the artists of all of the music in the video. How could I solve this? Is there any safe free options without needing to credit the authors? If not, I was thinking about buying a basic subscription for Artlist, but it says that you can monetise only one channel on each platform, which obviously is not enough for me. Do they allow the music to be used on multiple different channels if the videos are not monetised? Thank you a lot for all of the answers!","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Idk how to continue my editing path Well a bit of lore but u can skip to the MAIN PART, if you want so. I'm 15 male, i've been editing for 2years( more or less). When i was starting to edit - i was kinda really happy and obsessed with it. ( 12h sessions of creating etc ) I was discovering a lot of new and thinked about getting money sometime( definitely not soon). ( Most of works i did were anime and other edits for utube & tiktok. ) then after 7-10months. I somehow found 2 clients to work with. ( It's rather they found me in the time ) 1) First guy gave me a stable job where i could get a really great money for a 14yo teen in my country. But there was a catch is that those vids didn't have a lot of views and were really boring to edit with time. So it didn't last long (3-4 months ) and in some time we said our farewells. To be honest this thing gave me amount of money and took a lot of time and energy. ( While this thing i didn't post a single one vid on my channel = didn't make any vids which were really close to my teen's soul ) after We leaved each other I made some vids but their amount can't be compared to period without any jobs. 2) Second guy - I'm working with him by today and he gives projects much more seldom than 1th guy, but usually they're much more interesting to edit. So I can say he keeps me editing from time to time. MAIN PART And why the hell did I write it? - Summer came and I intented to make videos again ( often ). I often think about making ~the same difficulty vids I made before clients, But I can't get inspired to anything. I'm listening to any music I liked / like - come up with nothing. Watching works on social medias - nothing. I watched a really great serial recently, and I really liked, The previous me would have already made an edit for it - nothing. I also thought about finding another client but It seems much more hard than just to find strength to make a lovely vid for myself. Idk maybe I just grew up and should move forward and learn something new lol. Actually all this sounds kinda funny like - guy just sit and do something but I fucking can't. Maybe some of you guys have already met similar dead end So I'd like to get some piece of advice=/","label":0}

Does anyone know if self-insurance is necessary when working as a sole operator, on a one-off job, for a big, professional company? Said friend is being asked to provide insurance documentation proving that he is insured for losses/damages of up to two million pounds. This seems an absurdly high amount of cover for someone editing in-house, on company equipment. He did the gig and wasn’t insured, neither was he asked for any proof of insurance beforehand.

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking for golf channel editor! We’re launching a new YouTube channel focused on golf content. We will be having 6-hole challenges, full 18-hole matches, competitive formats, and random content in between. We’re looking for a creative and reliable video editor who can help us bring this content to life with a polished, YouTube-friendly style. The ideal editor will have experience working with vlog-style or sports YouTube content and a strong sense of pacing, music, and storytelling. You should be comfortable creating engaging edits from multi-camera footage, syncing external audio, and incorporating basic graphics and text overlays. One of the most important aspects of the job will be your ability to add shot tracers scoreboards which are essential to how we want to present our matches. Familiarity with those tools is highly valued. We typically film full 18-hole rounds and break them into multiple episodes (such as 3 videos of 6 holes each). All footage is provided via SSD handoff (if local) or cloud upload, and audio is recorded separately using a Zoom H6 and DJI wireless microphones. If you have experience working with external multi-track audio and syncing in post, that is needed. Our budget for editing a full 18-hole round is around $200-$300 which could be three short episodes, two 9 hole episodes, or one 18 hole episode depending on the context. As we grow the channel and begin generating revenue, we’d love to build a long-term working relationship with someone who can grow alongside us. We’re collaborative and open to feedback, our goal is to find an editor who understands the vibe we’re going for and can help us shape the identity of the channel. If you’re interested, please reach out with a few examples of your work. Especially if you’ve edited challenge-style, vlog, or golf-related content before. Let us know a bit about your editing background, workflow, and what kind of projects you enjoy. Looking forward to connecting!","label":1}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Recruitment video - i need help Hi everyone! I’m working on a recruitment video for a café looking to hire new baristas, and it needs to be in a vertical format. The café is in a bustling shopping mall, so it’s a high-energy, fast-paced, and sometimes stressful environment. The goal is to capture the emotions of being a barista (excitement, teamwork, pride) in a Fast and Furious trailer style, as the manager jokingly requested. My vision for the video structure is: a calm opening (prep time), hectic peak hours, and a satisfying close. I’m planning to rely on music and minimal dialogue. Honestly, I’m a bit lost on how to pull this off, especially with the vertical format. Any ideas or advice on how to best capture the café’s vibe and meet the client’s expectations?

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking for a Golf Editor! We’re launching a new YouTube channel focused on golf content. We will be having 6-hole challenges, full 18-hole matches, competitive formats, and random content in between. We’re looking for a creative and reliable video editor who can help us bring this content to life with a polished, YouTube-friendly style. The ideal editor will have experience working with vlog-style or sports YouTube content and a strong sense of pacing, music, and storytelling. You should be comfortable creating engaging edits from multi-camera footage, syncing external audio, and incorporating basic graphics and text overlays. One of the most important aspects of the job will be your ability to add shot tracers scoreboards which are essential to how we want to present our matches. Familiarity with those tools is highly valued. We typically film full 18-hole rounds and break them into multiple episodes (such as 3 videos of 6 holes each). All footage is provided via SSD handoff (if local) or cloud upload, and audio is recorded separately using a Zoom H6 and DJI wireless microphones. If you have experience working with external multi-track audio and syncing in post, that is needed. Our budget for editing a full 18-hole round is around $200-$300 which could be three short episodes, two 9 hole episodes, or one 18 hole episode depending on the context. As we grow the channel and begin generating revenue, we’d love to build a long-term working relationship with someone who can grow alongside us. We’re collaborative and open to feedback, our goal is to find an editor who understands the vibe we’re going for and can help us shape the identity of the channel. If you’re interested, please reach out with a few examples of your work. Especially if you’ve edited challenge-style, vlog, or golf-related content before. Let us know a bit about your editing background, workflow, and what kind of projects you enjoy. Looking forward to connecting!","label":1}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Hiring a gaming editor - $200/ video Hi, I'm currently running a YouTube channel (gaming related) and I'm looking to elevate my videos to the next level. I'm quite close to monetization and I plan to start producing two videos 10-18 mins every week so ideally I will need someone who is interested in a longer terms arrangement and can provide a quick turn around time. These videos won't need crazy edits or anything, I just need you to add in memes and image overlays and motion effects to improve the overall quality. What I'll provide: * A rough cut of the video project in premiere pro, I'll upload all clips etc.. to a cloud. * Audio (background music I want to use and narration track) * References to give you an idea of what I want. What I'll expect from you: * A portfolio of previous work. Ideally someone who has worked on gaming videos in the past. * Be able to offer a fast turn around time. * Able to replicate edits from the references I provide. In terms of price, we can discuss that but I'm thinking a flat fee for every video and then once the channel is monetized we can discuss a rev share (for the videos you work on) on top of the flat fee. If interested just drop me a PM or leave a message below with a way for me to contact you. Thanks","label":1}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Hiring an editor for Youtube 100 Days videos The above link is a link to my channel's most recent video and a perfect example of what i will expect from my editor. PAY- base line price of 300$ FLAT US with 50-100$ bonus depending on quality. Time- Usually a week but anything shorter will be paid extra. Reason- I have a full time job and can longer edit my videos myself Expectations- Stay within the timeframe, usually takes me 10 hours to do an hour long video. Know about the game (ARK SURVIVAL EVOVLED), Know about 100 Day videos. The edits themselves is just finding the clip that corresponds to the script and putting transitions/memes/sound effects where appropriate. The files are usually large due to how i record, think 500gbs (I record in MKV but will start auto converting to mp4 to shorten that) the amount of footage can be anywhere from 50 hrs to 100hrs but a lot of time its deadspace and is detailed in the script that i went (afk) since the hope is for someone else to be doing it, i can make a more detailed description such as \"afk skip to 1:50 in recording\" depends on what is preferred. I record my script's audio and will send it over. Only want serious request, will ignore anyone who ask me the price (clearly didnt read my description on that), ask to be paid in any form other than paypal/venmo/etc ((aka i will not pay in bitcoins or some crypto), any conversion fee will come out of the total amount)), whats the game about, or about what it is i want to do. Will not negotiate- I do feel like the price is fair thats around 30 an hour, might take longer for the first time but after that its really up to you. However with the growth of the channel im willing to increase to max 400 with 50-100 bonus depending on quality and eventually shorts (negotiable) when the time comes.","label":1}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Hiring Video Editor I’m a Roblox content creator looking for a skilled video editor to help take my videos to the next level.

I already edit myself, so I know the process — but I want someone who can push it beyond my current level and bring that extra polish and creativity. Here’s what you’ll get from me: * Footage already cleaned up (all unusable parts cut out) * Audio and visual already synced * Camera footage already colour graded You won’t be sorting through hours of raw footage — just focused editing on a clean timeline with clear direction. This is for someone who’s serious about consistent freelance work. I’ll be requesting a couple of videos a week, so you’ll have reliable projects in your pipeline. When you message me, please include: * Your editing portfolio (especially if you’ve done gaming or meme-style content) * A quote for editing 15 and 20 minutes of cut-down footage (not raw) * Turnaround time * I was thinking USD$55 for 15 minutes and USD$65 for 20 minutes of cut-down (non-raw) footage.

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking to hire a video editor for a longform (1 hour) gaming video. Could lead to future work as well. Looking to find a solid video editor that I can hire a few times a year for longer style informative gaming videos and possibly hire as my full time editor down the road. My budget for this first video will be around $300, but I'm willing to negotiate if I feel we vibe together well and share a similar vision. I am a small channel, and this is just a passion hobby of mine at the moment that I am willing to throw money at to see where it can lead. It would be great to find an editor that can grow with me and my channel. My current favorite style of editing is pretty much anything on WolfeyVGC's channel on youtube. Here is a recent example - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMaPFo-s8PQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMaPFo-s8PQ) He uses lots of overlays, clever cuts, and motion graphics to emphasize the story he is telling. Also a big fan of Smallant's produced videos such as this - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajydOPmdBm4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajydOPmdBm4) Because of this, I'm looking for someone who is experienced with graphics and animation, and is able to add their own creative touches, as well as pull from their own gaming knowledge and experience to add emphasis and details when it adds to the experience. This particular project will be a reflective look at the entire Resident Evil series, so if you have a working knowledge of the series, you'll immediately move to the top of my candidates. For clarity, I will be arranging all the clips and narration myself. I just need someone to add graphics, overlays, and other finishing touches, as well as having an open dialogue on things you see that can be improved to what has already been done by me. If interested, please send me your portfolio and we can chat. Please also note, that I will need to see the finished video before paying (though we can work out a small deposit or holding fee if you have verified references) You can watermark it for your own safety as well prior to payment, but it's incredibly easy to get scammed online so we will need to work through a 3rd party such as paypal business.

{"text":"[REDDIT] [HIRING] Looking for a YouTube Video Editor for Faceless Football (Soccer) Channel – Long-Term Growth Together Hi all, I’m a YouTube content creator and I recently launched a faceless channel called The Backline Academy, focused on helping football (soccer) players go pro. My content breaks down strategies, mindset, and pathways to becoming a professional player — all in a motivational and informative style. I’m currently looking for a video editor who can help bring my ideas to life. Since the channel is faceless, I don’t have personal clips or footage — so I need someone who’s comfortable sourcing stock footage, match clips (if allowed), graphics, or motion elements to create compelling videos. ⚽️ What I’m looking for: • Someone who can work with voiceovers/scripts and turn them into engaging videos. • Willing to grow together with the project. The channel is still in its early stages, and I don’t have a big budget right now. • Ideally, someone who believes in the long-term vision and is okay with very little (or no) upfront payment, with the understanding that as the channel and my connected Skool community grow and generate income, you’ll be compensated accordingly. The goal is to build a partnership: I grow, you grow. As I start earning more from YouTube and course sales, the editor will be the first person I invest in. If you’re interested, please send: • Your current rates, even if flexible. • A short intro about yourself and why this project speaks to you. Thanks in advance — let’s build something great! • The Backline Academy.","label":1}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Films to inspire indie filmmakers? We've all heard of *The Blair Witch Project, Napoleon Dynamite, Clerks, El Mariachi, Paranormal Activity* etc. But what are some films you know of that punched way above their weight class on their budget? As in they achieved a big budget look on very limited finances? I'll start: Gaelan Connell's 2017 movie *Blood, Sand & Gold* is an action movie made for only $250,000. It spans 5 countries, and is complete with car chases/crashes, explosions, shootouts, and people jumping out of helicopters. *Terrifier* and *Terrifier 2* are slasher films made for $35,000 and $250,000. They have the full array of gore effects, costumes, sets, extras, etc. So many films made in the $250,000 range seem to be 2 actors sitting in a house drinking coffee. Maybe some people find the low budget look charming, but indie filmmakers shouldn't limit themselves and need to see what's possible on a very low budget.","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Beware of shady editors on here Community First off I wanna say, in the past I’ve worked with editors from this group before & had no issues. Unfortunately there’s always a few bad apples in the bunch. So I’m more so writing this so anyone looking to hire from this group can be cautious of potential scams. The “editor” @Background_use_3409 on here & @anutani on discord is more than likely a scammer. So at first I just thought he had terrible communication but as time went on it became evident that he was just giving me the run around. I’ve provided screenshots of our convos on discord and Reddit here: https://imgur.com/a/GAM2GM9 I will say…he did keep the act up pretty good tho 😅 even asking updates on the project and all after I already sent the $. To start things off I gave him a small 3 min project but I became a lil sussed out when he asked for an 50% advance on Wise (Luckily I only sent $16) & i have reported him now. But From my knowledge asking for an 50% advance as an editor before a project is not uncommon but I will no longer be doing that. There’s other ways to make the client & the editor both feel comfortable. I for one will suggest using water marks over the work you’re showing & also sending it in a lower resolution. I mean I also shoulda looked into things a bit more because looking at his profolio now, the works he has listed as his own most likely were edited by someone else. But Since i had so much going on plus with me never having any issues with hiring an editor on here…I didn’t go as hard to make sure he was legit which ofc was my mistake. Anyways BEWARE of editors who: -require full payment or advances - too many excuses -very slow communication -idk maybe WISE app… (that was my first time using it lol)","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking to help manage channels (I'm a creator too so I get the struggle) What's up everyone. So I've been creating content for a while now (gaming and some spiritual stuff) and honestly it's exhausting trying to do everything yourself while dealing with life. I've been in the same boat as probably most of you - wanted help with my channel but every \"manager\" I talked to either had no clue about actual content creation or wanted like $500+ a month which is insane for smaller channels. Never found anyone who actually understood what I needed without breaking the bank. So I figured why not offer this myself at a price that actually makes sense. **What I can do:** - Find trending stuff and content ideas (I do this for my own channels anyway) - Give you real feedback on videos/thumbnails - Basic editing help if needed (I use DaVinci, not amazing at it but I know enough) - Keep you motivated when you're burnt out (we all been there) - Handle comments and community stuff - Look at your analytics and figure out what's working - Just generally keep you on track **The deal:** $50-75/week depending on what you need. I'm thinking like 3-5 hours of work. And if your channel starts making real money we can switch to percentage instead - I want us both to win. I'm only looking for maybe 3-4 people to start with so I don't spread myself too thin. If you're serious about growing but just need someone in your corner who actually gets it, hit me up. Gaming, lifestyle, whatever - as long as you're consistent and want to improve. tbh this seems like it could work out for everyone involved","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Downloading Wistia videos: finally made easy for video editing Hello dear video editors, I'm not one of you. I'm just an entrepreneur / business owner. But I've been actively working with video editors in the last 3 years. And during that time, I've always struggled with Wistia. Here's what I mean. Whenever I come across a video I find important enough to save, I would simply download it (there are ways to download form Facebook, Youtube, Vimeo, etc...) But I always found it impossible to download Wistia videos. I always thought Wistia designed it on purpose to make it impossible to download their vids. It was so frustrating to me and to the video editors I was collaborating with. Sometimes I'd need to send them a Wistia vid to take a clip from. Or they'd need to download and archive one for inspiration on a future project. It was just impossible. I finally decided to create a tool that would download any Wistia vid easily in 1 click. I launched it as a [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fhmlmcbfjnegdoafmfcfmhpahfegdjlp?utm_source=item-share-cb), and it's free to use. I got almost 2000 users, and the video editors who are using it just love it. If it's something you'd want to use, I'd be very happy if you can please send me your feedback. I'd be super happy if you'd inform me of any bug or issue you face, or tell me about any additional feature you may need! I'd really be thankful.

{"text":"[REDDIT] I got tired of the tedious bilingual subtitle workflow, so I built an AI Mac app to automate it. Hey everyone, As someone who frequently works with video, I've always found creating accurate, well-timed bilingual subtitles to be one of the most time-consuming parts of the post-production process. Manually transcribing, splitting lines perfectly, getting context-aware translations (not just awkward machine translations), and then formatting everything into a clean SRT file... it's a huge time sink. To solve my own problem, I spent the last few months building a native macOS app called **MocaSubtitle**. My goal was to create a tool that felt like a natural part of a professional editing workflow. Here’s how it automates the process: * **✓ Fast Transcription:** Just drop in your video or audio file, and it handles the transcription locally. * **✓ AI-Powered Workflow:** It uses an AI model for intelligent sentence splitting (no more awkward line breaks!) and—most importantly—**contextual translation**, which is far more accurate than standard tools. * **✓ BYOK Model (Bring Your Own Key):** This is key for professionals. The app is powered by the DeepSeek model, but you connect your **own API key**. This means your source material stays private, you have full control over your costs, and you aren't paying me a markup on API calls. * **✓ Direct SRT Export:** When you're done, it exports a clean, standard `.srt` file, ready for you to import directly into Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro, or any other NLE.","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Avid: Exports look soft & washed out after relinking to high-res Hey editors, I’m running into a frustrating issue with Avid and hoping someone can shed some light. I’m cutting a project with 5.9K source footage (5952x3968 H.264). My workflow: * I linked the originals, transcoded to low-res DNx for editing, * Project format was 1920x1080 the entire time, * Once the cut was locked, I relinked everything back to the full-res media for export. But when I export (even at 3840x2160 H.264, high bitrate), the result looks soft and slightly off. Shadows are getting crushed, blacks look kind of washed out, and it just doesn’t feel sharp, like Avid is degrading the image somewhere in the pipeline. I tested the exact same cut in both Prem and Resolve, with my sequence size still at 1920x1080, and the exports look great in both, sharp, clean, and no weird gamma issues. Out of curiosity, I created a new UHD (3840x2160) project in Avid, relinked the same media, exported again, and that version looked way better, even when exporting at 1080p. So it seems like the project raster in Avid (1920x1080) was bottlenecking the output, even after relinking to high-res footage. So now I’m confused: * Why bother relinking to high-res if Avid’s 1080p project caps the quality anyway? * Should I work on a UHD project? * And why do blacks look slightly washed out? Honestly, Avid has been really difficult on this front compared to other NLEs, curious if others have workarounds or a best-practice pipeline for relinking and exporting high-res media cleanly. Appreciate any tips. Thanks!","label":0}

The slider only seems to move in whole-number increments (e.g. 84 to 85), but I want to make finer adjustments, like 84.1 or 84.2, similar to how Premiere lets you do that with Command + Option for 0.1 steps. https://preview.redd.it/2dnyidu1nh9f1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=029504396aafabc996849678b1135fb5c657c82f Is there a way to enable finer pixel/decimal control in Avid, or a modifier key that allows smaller increments with the slider?

I work on long form video podcasts with guests who often have PR teams who want to review and mark edits before publication. I’m hoping someone out there might know of a great media review/collaboration platform that checks more boxes than what we’ve been using so far. We’ve currently use [Frame.io](http://Frame.io) because it gets close enough (and has Adobe integration..albeit very buggy) and Dropbox for file management (expensive, also buggy and terrible for sharing outside Dropbox users) and I have tried [Krock.io](http://Krock.io) and Descript — and while each one does *something* well, none of them seem to have all the essentials we need. Here’s our ideal setup — let me know if you’ve come across anything that ticks these boxes: # Essentials: * Cloud-based media review platform (stable, user-friendly) * Easy sharing with people **outside** the team — ideally **no login required** * Viewers must be able to **leave precise time-specific comments** * **Everyone on the team** should be able to see and reply to comments * **Transcript displayed alongside the media** — ideally scrolling along with media and connected to comments just as media is..... * Shareable via a single link that includes **both media and transcript** # Bonus features: * Ability to **highlight a section of the transcript** and leave a comment instead of using the timeline * Basic **integration with Premiere Pro** (or at least import/export of markers) * Clean, intuitive UI for non-technical reviewers * Affordable for small teams # Why the current options fall short: * **Frame.io**: Good overall, but the commenting is *really* finicky when it comes to precise timecodes. and No transcript. * **Descript**: Best transcript integration by far, and public share links look great — but you can’t comment unless you’re inside the app, and that requires an account. Also pretty pricey. * **Dropbox, Krock,**: Fine for basic reviews, but no transcript, and the collaboration/commenting features are limited or clunky. Thanks in advance for the help.","label":0}

So I've been creating content for a while now (gaming and some spiritual stuff) and honestly it's exhausting trying to do everything yourself while dealing with life. I've been in the same boat as probably most of you - wanted help with my channel but every \"manager\" I talked to either had no clue about actual content creation or wanted like $500+ a month which is insane for smaller channels. Never found anyone who actually understood what I needed without breaking the bank. So I figured why not offer this myself at a price that actually makes sense. **What I can do:** - Find trending stuff and content ideas (I do this for my own channels anyway) - Give you real feedback on videos/thumbnails - Basic editing help if needed (I use DaVinci, not amazing at it but I know enough) - Keep you motivated when you're burnt out (we all been there) - Handle comments and community stuff - Look at your analytics and figure out what's working - Just generally keep you on track **The deal:** $50-75/week depending on what you need. I'm thinking like 3-5 hours of work. And if your channel starts making real money we can switch to percentage instead - I want us both to win. I'm only looking for maybe 3-4 people to start with so I don't spread myself too thin. If you're serious about growing but just need someone in your corner who actually gets it, hit me up.

{"text":"[REDDIT] [PAID] Indie developer looking for SNES style tunes! Heyo r/gameDevClassifieds! I'm currently working on a game that can best be described as, \"what if StarTropics got a sequel on the SNES?\" Part of that is capturing the look, feel, and sound of that game and console as much as possible. I got the first two, but I'll never be a talented musician - hopefully that's where someone here can come in! What I'd ultimately like is music that gives the same general feels as the music in the original StarTropics - a mix of upbeat island tunes, chill village vibes, spooky dungeon themes, that sort of thing - only brought up to a SNES-sounding, 16-bit level with all the sound font, muffled, reverb goodness that comes with it. I'm a solo indie dev so would likely have to buy tracks a la carte; that said, I'm willing to negotiate fair prices (y'all got a skill you deserve to be compensated for) and prefer to build relationships with artists and return to them for repeat business. At the end of the day I'm estimating I'll need 10-15 tracks total by the end, and I'm hoping to ship within the next 2-2.5 years (realistic expectations). If anyone is interested, I'd love to hear from you and hear some of your portfolio! I'm a pretty chill guy, understand the creative process, and believe in artistic collaboration. I also have screenshots and an end-to-end demo (currently using StarTropics music as a placeholder) that I'm happy to share if it feels like we vibe. And if I don't hear from you?

Be it prepping for Steam wishlists, pitching to a publisher or just trying to hit a milestone without your production catching fire. **What to expect from us, animation-wise:** * Game-ready animation that works in engine. We're used to delivering multiple animations for projects where only the first has the expected back-and-forth of technical refinement. * Rigging support if needed (we can advise if it’ll help add more punch) * What you might consider affordable is subjective so in the spirit of transparency, we work on fixed budgets generally starting out between $1-20k and it works out roughly to $45-65/hour. This includes producers to manage the project and art leads who complete expert QA to maintain quality. * Why put your project at risk? We're an established studio with the infrastructure to keep your project confidential and insurance to protect against claims. We never ghost you, we're always here. We work with you directly and fill in the gaps where things usually slip. All this is to give you the confidence that together, we can build your *commercially* successful indie game so you can make this game dev thing a living. **Need more than animation?** We support indies with a whole bunch including 2D & 3D characters, environments, UI, trailers, promo art, trailer and more. And depending on where you’re headed, we know exactly how to help indies get pitch-ready, connect with publishers and make smart decisions ahead of launch.

{"text":"[REDDIT] Shadow Bans on YouTube Are Real — Here’s What Happened to My Channel After Violations I want to share something a lot of creators suspect, but few have fully confirmed: YouTube absolutely applies shadow suppression if your channel gets hit with multiple ad violations or flags. And I’m living proof of it. ⸻ 🔻 My Channel Was Growing Consistently Until April Everything was growing well — steady views, great engagement, high click-through rates (CTR), and strong RPM. Then around mid-April, I got hit with multiple “Limited Ads” flags on some of my uploads. No community guideline strikes. No demonetization. Just Limited Ads — and most of them I appealed and won. But the damage was already done. ⸻ 🚨 What Changed After That? Suddenly, every video I posted after that point had the same frustrating pattern: • 🔍 Browse features dominated traffic (Home feed) • ❌ Suggested Videos dropped to near zero (like 2–5%) • 📉 Subscriber-heavy audience split — barely any non-subscribed viewers • 📊 CTR stayed amazing (9%–11%), and retention was strong — but YouTube just wasn’t pushing them • 🧊 It felt like my channel was frozen in place And yet, my older videos from before the violations were still getting Suggested traffic and performing normally. ⸻ 🕵️‍♂️ This Is the Shadow Suppression Pattern Here’s what I’ve confirmed (and what YouTube doesn’t openly tell you): If you receive multiple ad-suitability violations in a short window (even if appealed and approved), YouTube may silently suppress your channel’s reach. No strikes. No notice. Just reduced trust, which leads to limited visibility in Suggested/Recommended videos. This can last up to 90 days — and everything you upload in that window is affected. ⸻ 🔓 When Will It End? • My violations started around April 15 • That means the full suppression is expected to lift around mid-July (Day 90) • YouTube sometimes begins testing again around Day 75, with Suggested traffic slowly coming back I’m already prepping for that “unfreeze moment,” because many creators have seen their suppressed videos blow up later once the penalty ends. ⸻ ✅ What You Can Do If This Happens to You 1. Keep uploading. You’re building trust back. 2. Space out risky content. Don’t post multiple borderline videos in a row. 3. Be honest with ad self-certification. It builds long-term credibility with the system. 4. Don’t panic if a video gets flagged. One mistake won’t kill you — but multiple close together might. 5. Focus on retention + CTR. YouTube still measures these, even while suppressed. ⸻ 🧠 Final Thoughts Yes — this kind of invisible penalty is real, and it’s terrifying when you don’t know what’s happening. But you can recover from it. I’m close to the end of my suppression window now, and I wanted to share this in case it helps anyone else dealing with the same silent throttling. You’re not crazy. You’re not shadowbanned in the conspiracy-theory sense. But YouTube is quietly pulling the brakes — and you can absolutely fight your way back. ⸻ Let me know if you’ve experienced this too. I’d love to connect with other creators navigating the same thing. — A very tired but stubborn creator","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] YouTube removed my channel, denied my appeal, and said \"you got denied, too bad\" I am heartbroken. That sounds ridiculous, but it's true. I had 2 accounts, one I've had for nearly 2 decades, used daily, and paid for Premium on. The other was a work account. I'm a journalist & video editor, so I used that account to post my reel and extra videos to link to job applications. That was the account that got removed for \"severe or repeated violations of our **spam, deceptive practices and scams policy.\"** It happened yesterday. I had uploaded videos a few weeks ago to apply for a specific job, then I didn't use it. I rarely used this account and definitely didn't spam anyone. Out of the blue, it's removed. I appealed, a couple hours later I got the bot response that it was denied. \"We reviewed your channel carefully, and have confirmed that it violates our spam, deceptive practices and scams policy.\" Again, no indication of HOW it violates the policy. I reached out to Google support, who got me in touch with the YouTube Team, and I got a response back saying \"If you'd like more information related to the violation, I'd advise you to check the emails that YouTube sent you in connection with your channel termination.\" I responded back asking to see actual proof, because I have yet to be told exactly what it was. I am awaiting a response from that email. I've never scammed anyone, tried to deceive anyone, or spammed accounts. I am so confused about how this happened. \"We have permanently removed your channel from YouTube. Going forward, you won't be able to access, possess, or create any other YouTube channels.\" I can't even make a new account. I don't even care about the work account. I just want my personal one back. It has so many memories on it and I am actually grieving the loss of it. Anyway, anyone else dealt with this, and was able to get their account back? If you didn't get it back, how in the world did you cancel you Premium without being able to log in? I'm supposed to be charged tomorrow and I can't use the service.","label":0}

I'm planning to start a YouTube channel focused on math-related content and I’d really love to hear your input before I start. What kind of math content would you actually enjoy watching? Here are a few questions I'm looking answer to: \\-Do you prefer short-form videos or longer, more in-depth ones? \\-Do you like visualizations and animations or do you prefer someone explaining in front of a camera or a whiteboard? \\-Are you more interested in broad conceptual explanations or do you prefer specific problems and their solutions? \\-Do you enjoy a casual and humorous tone or do you prefer a more serious, no-nonsense approach? \\-Are you curious about the history of math, how ideas were developed and the people behind them or are you more interested in current topics, modern mathematicians or stories from math competitions like the math olympiad? \\-Would you rather see real world applications of math concepts (past or present) or are you more into pure theory and abstraction? \\-What areas of math interest you the most? Algebra, Calclus, Set Theory, 2D/3D Geometry, Statistics? \\-What level do you prefer: high school level and exam prep,or more advanced university level math with unfamiliar topics?

{"text":"[REDDIT] Is this a decent camera for new content creators? Hello all! I'm hoping for a little advice from someone more experienced in content creation than myself. To save you having to read my rambling, there is a camera I'm considering but can't seem to post the link, but on Amazon it's called: \"8K 64MP Video Camera Camcorder, 18X Digital Zoom with IR Night Version Vlogging Camera for Youtube, 3.0\" IPS Touch Screen with one 4500mAh Battery, 32GB TF Card, Remote Control, Mic, and Adapter\" It's not too pricey ($149.99 and a $20 off coupon) and has some decent reviews (4.8 stars). I most likely won't use the microphone. I would prefer to do voice overs so I don't have to restrict my entire house to silence when I'm making a video. Does anyone have experience with this camera or other recommendations? Thoughts? If you do want/need more information: I'm going to try my hand at starting a cooking channel in the very near future. I'm incredibly nervous because I have little to no online presence. I haven't posted anything publicly...maybe ever? Not for 15 years at least. I love cooking, especially for other people and always get the \"how did you make this?\", \"can I get the recipe?\", etc. Now I'm living in the USA (previously from Australia), so the differences in available ingredients and different kinds of recipes is really inspiring. I'm not working at the moment and don't really need to because my husband makes enough that we are comfortable (as in, we can pay our bills and maybe have a weekly date night, not rich! If anyone is recommending a camera, please make sure it's affordable), so I thought, what the hell! I have nothing to lose and worst case, I gain a hobby. Anyway, probably more information than you need... I'm a nervous rambler XD So when I pursue this, I'm going to need a camera that is good for close ups because I'm not planning on showing my face in most videos, I just want it to be about the recipes I'm making. I'd also happily take any other suggestions on how to make my channel a success. Any comments, suggestions or thoughts would be very, very appreciated ❤️","label":0}
{"text":"[REDDIT] Tips on speeding up video production? A little under two years ago, I wrote a 2 hour video essay on a subject I'm crazy passionate about (I'm autistic and have a tendency to accrue encyclopedic knowledge on the things I'm interested in- I originally expected it to only be around 30 minutes but I had a lot to say haha). While I was of course hoping that people would see the video, it did better than I ever expected and reached 100k views within the first two months (might also be worth noting I still had under 1k subscribers before uploading). I was going through a rough mental health patch at the time, and it was the first time I'd ever made something of this scale, so that video took me 9 months total to write, record, and edit. After seeing some success, I realized making video essays is a great mixture of the things I'm passionate about- I love writing, researching, video editing, and drawing (which is less applicable admittedly). Because of my aforementioned shit mental health, I didn't have the energy or stability to start on another video for around a year, but I wanted to do another one that entire time. Now, I'm finally in the editing stages of my second video essay- it probably won't come out to be quite as long as the first, but I expect it to be at least an hour long when it's done. I don't plan how long I want a video to be before I start writing, I just write down what I find interesting in my research and consider it done whenever I've said all I wanted to say on the subject, whether it turns out to be a 10 minute script or a 90 minute script. I imagine a lot of the advice I'll get is \"make shorter videos,\" but that isn't really the style I'm going for. Again, while I'm fine with a shorter video if the subject calls for it, I'm very heavily inspired by creators like Defunctland, Hbomberguy, and Jenny Nicholson, who all tend toward longer, more thorough videos, with less frequent uploads. So all that said- while I am totally comfortable with continuing to make longer videos and with taking my time with production- I am also admittedly moving at a snail's pace. I would love to make this my full-time job someday, and I know that it must be possible even with less frequent uploads because so many of the channels I like do this full-time and also only upload like twice a year lol, but realistically even I'm hating the slowness by now. I don't dedicate *every* day to video production- I do have a day job and a life- but I've been trying to keep my nose more to the grindstone with this video and I'm still 2-3 months into editing and only halfway done. I do expect some of my slowness to go away with time and practice in making videos of this scale, but in the meantime, does anyone have any tips on how to streamline the process some more? What is your workflow like? Are there any obvious pointers for beginners I'm missing?","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Struggling to branch out/ How to? Hey everyone. I recently started my channel in late march. I didn't even have any big thoughts behind it. In the past, none of my YouTube tries worked, no matter what I did. My thought was just to create and have fun when suddenly within this very small niche I gained a following very quickly and well, I'd say. But here comes the issue. I make content for a rather new yet very small game. The game is struggling like hell and I would not surprised if it goes EOS in a few years. On top of it, a lot of creators I used to be friends with are fatigued from the game and how it is being treated and leaving. The views are good for the community it is. I have one of the highest performing and best doing channels, but in contrast to YouTube itself...It's a small fart. I'm close to being monetized and it won't ever be enough to be able to do it more seriously. I love the game, so I keep going, but recently I am so fatigued from creating and playing. I sort of accidentally got pushed into this \"guide maker\" role, on top of it all, too. Whenever I make polls asking about what video they'd like to see next, it is ALWAYS the guides that win. Very little people wanna see fun stuff. I never planned for it to be like this yet I'm scared to upload something different. Fast forward, I don't think doing a this game-only channel on a game that's so small is sustainable, so I wanna branch out, but I have seen a couple of other creators in the space upload a couple different videos and...just nobody cared. One dude then went back to the game for another month and now he has quit entirely. Streamers I watch in the community get constantly spammed if they play another game that isn't this! I like many games in similar genre (anime focused style or story pg games) and even though I am not 100% sure on what content to do, I want to branch out. So I was honest about it, talking about the games state and I did a poll for other games I play. And would you look at it...people in the poll as well as my discord server already ticked the option that they wouldn't watch anything else. I tweaked my bio to not have the \"this game creator\" in there anymore. It now sounds more open and broad as well as me not only making helpful content, but the algo won't handle this well, right? If I publish Y game and people are here for X, barely any subs will click on Y game and YouTube will think the video is bad. Or that's how I was taught. TLDR: Scared my hard work in the last 3 months goes to shit, but I am burned out. How to successfully branch out to grow without killing your channel?","label":0}

I want to start a YouTube channel with mostly funny and relatable content but I'm also working on a web show that'll be my modern representation of Greek Mythology. Anyway, my parents never let my siblings and I watch YouTube videos growing up (which is understandable because there is content on YouTube that isn't for kids) but I'm 18 now and I'm an adult. My birthday was literally 2 days ago and I haven't brought it up to them yet. I've come close but I get so nervous I feel like throwing up. I've considered keeping it a secret but I still live with my parents and I'm planning to for at least another year so that seems too difficult and I don't like hiding things like this from them either. My biggest problem is how to start the conversation because I feel like it would be weird to just out of the blue say, \"Mom, I want to start a YouTube channel.\" I also don't know what to expect. I've been watching YouTube videos for the past few months because what does it even matter I'm almost done with my senior year of high school, what YouTube video could be that bad?

I want to create a world, a very basic world, using the same characters and sometimes locations, such as a bedroom or garden. The packages I've found so far offer pricey and very high-tech animation. As great as they are, I find this kind of animation kind of tacky. It's my belief it will become tacky very soon. I want to edit the videos myself, so I don't need something like Plotagon, which can animate a script. I will use video along with my animation, maybe still images, too. Some other software I found offers talking head animation, but that looks kind of business-related. I kind of want it to look amateurish, or like it was made cheaply in the 1970s. I've used a chatbot to help me and have looked at a bunch of apps online, but I haven't found quite what I'm looking for, so I wondered if any of you would have suggestions: a place I can create super simple characters, locations, save them, and take them with me to new places. If I require complex images, I'll use video or images. Thanks","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Should I delete my channel? (Not what you think!) To summarize I've been making D&D content for the better part of 2 years now, mixing in shorts of my own twitch channel, my own edited shorts about spells or other D&D things, posts, and all the like. I've tried really hard for this last year in particular to REALLY dial up the quality of all my editing, and the very few people who do watch my stuff do see that effort blossoming. BUT here is the problem, when I first began I was just spitballing every idea to get some bearing to how my process would be. That included making content covering Lancer (a more niche ttrpg game) and a few other things like video games and even an abridgement of the old DND tv show. But suddenly my lancer content did super well (compared to my D&D stuff at least) but I think youtube is like pushing my channel down because I've split my audience down the middle. Where most people come by and return for lancer stuff (which I don't make anymore) and the few who come for my D&D stuff, which I continue to make even 2 years later. I can't be for sure, I have just over 1.2k subs, but I'm very sure about 1/6th or so of my followers are from 1 video (lancer video who would've guessed) So the question is... what should I do? Should I just wipe the slate, bite the bullet and reupload (most) everything to a new channel? Lose all my progress??? Or keep going on this channel? I DO want to keep making content, its quite my passion, but I'm so tired of putting 80+ hours into a video and it getting 100 views at best. (I know alot of like \"marketing\" goes into making videos too, ive been working on that too, but this question simply is aimed at addressing this thought)","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Please educate me about failure of my channel I have had zero experience creating or using social media prior to nine months ago. I have a channel that teaches meditation and proposes to teach how to be spiritually satisfied (feel free to check out my very small reddit page). I see the \"business\" as utilizing YouTube for marketing, not being primarily a \"YouTube channel.\" Nonetheless, YouTube seems like the obvious key platform to attempt to attract attention. (side note, open to other thoughts). The channel gathered about five hundred subscribers in nine months, mostly in the first five months, and has been in an extra-rut for about three months, and receiving negligible exposure to audiences and/or audiences don't like the content such that continued publication is no longer worth the return on time investment or expected growth. I am not ruffled by this, I'm psyched to rebrand and start fresh and charge forward with a very different, more informed approach to every part of the channel. Where I'm asking for guidance is I am trying to make a final estimate of whether or not the algorithm has a lasting \"dislike\" for the channel that can not be overcome more easily than rebuilding the humble number of subscribers - all else being equal. **Can you all help me with insights which will guide me to the clearest possible determination of the ongoing viability of this channel?** A few clues based on channel's relationship with the algo \\* The channel is packed with \"fuck, shit, sometimes cunt.\" \\* At least once I told them to \"Get the fuck off of YouTube.\" \\* There are negative mentions from me about Google, Amazon, Insta, etc. \\* There is copious reference to (natural) death as well as sometimes mentions of violence and gore \\* I took an ultra raw approach, and went for volume just to practice a lot, videos were mostly 20-35 minutes, unscripted, filled with extended pauses, shuffling around for equipment on camera, several videos had *very* poor audio recording \\* The actual \"message\" is not sweet or comfortable, either, is difficult to understand and goes radically against conventional views (e.g., the self is not real, etc.). I.e., could be seen as \"non-credible\" \\* There were all in all about 300 videos posted \\* at- Jes-ism is my channel The stats \\* Suggested views dropped to close to zero after month 2 \\* Browse features dropped to a drip after month 2 and then nearly flatlined at month 5 \\* Views were up and down for where I was at, but took a marked drop for the average video at about month 6 \\* Watch time net average has been stable for about 9 months at 2-4%, so low So looking at it now I guess both the algo and almost all of the audience were probably mostly appalled. Let me know if you believe it is more time effective to restart then to resuscitate the channel, say for having a healthier channel in 12 months - all things being equal. My plan is to clean up to words, diversify and improve the directorial ideas, clean up the image, edit diligently, and watch analytics a lot more. **Any specifics or general tips for the (likely) relaunch would be amazing and taken very seriously, as well**","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Why Your Content Gets Zero Views? I've noticed that a lot of people here don’t really understand how YouTube works. They try for months, uploading content regularly, but still get 0 or almost 0 views. After reading this post, you'll know how to fix that. But just remember, YouTube is a long-term game, not a quick run. Things take time. I'm a former YouTuber, and by the age of 16, I had achieved over a million total views with just 50 videos, starting from nothing. Now, at 19, I run my own graphic and editing studio to leverage my graphic design skills and YouTube game. I created it with people like me in mind, at the start, I didn’t know where to begin, and nobody offered me help like this. But now, to the point: If your content consistently gets 0 views, something is wrong and it’s not the YouTube algorithm’s fault. You need to understand that people come to YouTube to be entertained. If your videos are just raw, unedited 30-minute gameplay with no energy or value you won’t get views. This isn’t 2012 anymore. You have to add value, make your viewers engage, and stand out. Most importantly, you need a click-worthy title and thumbnail. That’s what gets people to even click your video. Even the best movies in cinema wouldn’t get watched if they had boring posters or trailers. Think of thumbnails as that for YouTube. Thumbnail and title are the first contact your potential viewer has with your content. So focus on these two the most. Of course, content quality is super important too, but thumbnails are like opening doors to people on YouTube to watch your stuff. That's it, no magic or mentor BS. If you have questions or need help, feel free to drop a comment I’ll try to respond to everyone.","label":0}

Blurry, compressed, and just nothing like the original I edited. Recently I got fed up and finally tried to figure out why it’s always so poor. Turns out, there’s actually a setting buried in Facebook that controls default video quality! Here’s what I did: Go to Settings & Privacy → Settings Search for “Video Default Quality” Change it from “Default” to “HD if available”. That helped a bit, but here’s the catch: even if you upload a 4K video, Facebook still compresses it, often down to 720p or 1080p. One tip I got from others was to enhance your video before uploading, using something like Aiarty Video Enhancer. This does help preserve more detail and sharpness post-upload. Is anyone else here still enduring with low video quality on Facebook uploads? Or found any tricks that actually work?","label":0}

You don’t buy a camera for the name. It’s a tool. You buy the tool that you need for the job. A wrench will not work for a job you need a screwdriver. This notion that any one brand is “better” than the other is nonsensical. All of them are good now. And if you need a specific camera, rent it. That’s what professionals do. A little background; I started with a Canon T1i for shooting photography and dabbled with video in high school. Then when I got to college I upgraded to the 7D, which was a bigger sensor but still was lacking video features. So switched to a GH4/GH5 for work and it worked great for what I needed. But for my first commercial I rented a A7iii for full frame. And it worked amazing! I was pleased but it didn’t make me want to sell my camera for my general needs. I only own for my personal projects and small jobs, bigger projects you’ll always rent.

The space includes a show kitchen where chefs will cook live for events or clients. The footage will be used for promotional edits and image films. Companies will rent the space and expect multi-angle footage. We need reliable, high-quality video from multiple fixed angles. **Camera setup needs:** * One top-down camera with a fisheye lens pointing to the table for long-form, wide-angle recording of the entire space. * One top-down camera above the kitchen island to capture food prep and cooking. * One front-facing camera to film the chef during cooking. * Some action cameras, e.g. Osmo Action 4, for direct capturing of people **How long do you need to record for?** Up to 4–5 hours per session, uninterrupted. **What equipment do you already have?** None relevant besides some phones. No knowledge or experience with camera systems. **What software do you edit in?** Adobe Premiere Pro 2024 or Davinci Resolve, undecided yet. **Additional Requirements** The entire camera setup should be controllable from a single laptop, if possible. I want to avoid manual configuration or movement for each session. Simplicity, remote control, and reliable multi-angle coverage are key priorities. It would be great to have some recommendations!

I most likely won't be shooting in 6k or ProRes from the get go, I'll likely start with 4k and h.265 (just considering how much memory ProRes footage takes up), and maybe eventually switch once I get a handle on things. I am trying to decide between the following: \\- either 2TB ($200CAD) or 4TB ($400CAD) Samsung T7 SSD \\- either 512GB ($170CAD) or 1TB ($340CAD) CFexpress Type B I guess I'm finding it hard to gauge how much memory I'm actually going to need starting out. I am not sure if it's better to go big and get both the 4TB SSD and 1TB CFexpress, or if that's way overkill to start out with, and if I should just go for the 512GB CFexpress and 2TB SSD. I know the actual amount of storage taken up will depend on other factors like bit rate etc, which I have yet to figure out. I also know some people like the redundancy of having two SSD's (for example, 2 2TBs instead of 1 4TB) and/or one 512 CFExpress and one 512 SD card. Any input is greatly appreciated!","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Writers, Directors & Editors... What is the worst \"note\" you've ever received? I did agency work for over a decade, so I have endless stories from what I now refer to as my \"sold out my soul era.\" Auto parts store owners acting like Scorsese over my shoulder and suggesting one tacky idea after another. Low energy clients insisting I write them into a commercial as the \"face\" of the business. But there have been a handful of moments by an actor on set or in production group chats where I just cringe at a note that they are passionate about. Sometimes its just so irrelevant that I am shocked at how hard they are pushing it. I've had actors insist I set up a new shot for them that I know I am not going to use. Sometimes the suggestion is like they aren't even making the same movie that I am - which falls on me, ultimately, but everyone else seems to get it... What revision note left such trauma that it still sticks on you to this day? Bonus points if you were forced to make the change and now you have basically disowned the whole project. 😆","label":0}
{"text":"[REDDIT] Looking For a Handheld \"Camcorder\" With Video Quality Reminiscient of 90s/00s Home Video Cameras? I'd really love to take videos on a camera that feel like the old home videos my dad used to take when I was growing up, both in filming and viewing. I've skimmed Amazon and all I can seem to find are very similar in the way one films, but not in video quality, as they try to have better image. Ideally, I'd want something handheld with the strap and flip-screen when recording, and 720p at the most for image quality, just so it really reminds me of the videos my family has from my childhood. I'm not a big camera guy so I'm not really sure where to look.","label":0}
{"text":"[REDDIT] The Steadicam's POV on our latest commercial Hey everyone! I wanted to share a behind the scenes video from our latest commercial project - which was a spot we directed for a charity. The piece relied heavily on steadicam work, and since we were shooting on a relatively tight lens in a grassy field (with very few natural tracking markers), we mounted an Insta360 as a witness cam for camera tracking everything afterwards. It also gave us some pretty great BTS footage as a bonus. Here is the final commercial in a 16:9 format on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UA5hOniPXUw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UA5hOniPXUw) I co-directed this with the co-founder of my production company, who also led the VFX work. Most of the VFX was done in Blender. The post timeline was very tight, so there are definitely a few shots we wish we had more time to polish. Curious if anyone else here has used a 360 cam as a witness before? Any workflows or tips you swear by?","label":0}
{"text":"[REDDIT] Pre-Viz versus the final shots - Commercial with VFX Hey everyone! Just wanted to share a few pre-visualisation mock-ups we put together to help communicate a pretty complex concept to the client for our latest commercial. We were really pleased with how closely the final shots ended up matching what we had mocked up a few weeks before the shoot. We also ran several video timing tests to map out the exact movement of both the performance and the camera. They ended up being so helpful not only for the client, but also the crew to understand the strange process. Those tests were 1:1 to the exact second in the end. Here is the final commercial in a 16:9 format on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UA5hOniPXUw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UA5hOniPXUw) All the previs was built in Blender by the co-director and VFX lead on the project.

{"text":"[REDDIT] I want to make a short film with my bunny as the protagonist maybe, help me come out with ideas please. i have always wanted to make a short film, I don’t want it to have any kind of budget, I just want to make something my my iPhone, some friends and a couple DJI mics. I’ve had trouble with coming up with any compelling story to tell. I have been taking videos and photos of nature for 10 years. I just don’t have any experience at all with storytelling. I was looking at my bunny today and I figured i could do a short film with him in it. He can serve as eye candy/clickbait haha, hes one of the cutest rabbits ever, he has the hair pattern of a cow, white and black. One of his eyes is blue and the other is brown, he is really tiny, he has short ears. He gets the zoomies a lot and yeah hes just really interesting to look at, he doesn’t look like a normal rabbit. His name is bolito. I was thinking the film could be titled “bolito y yo” (bolito and I) I guess the short film could be many things. It can be about a lonely guy with no friends who talks to his pet when he is bored. It can also be an adventure film about a guy that does hiking with a bunny, and walks on the beach with his bunny. since I live close to the beach and the forest, i could record stuff with him there if i put him in a harness with a leash. It could also be some sort if comedy, like it can some surrealist Atlanta type thing about a guy with a bunny with telepathy that gives advise to people. Theres many possibilities i think. hes a very beautiful creature and i guess i want an excuse to show close up clips of him and him doing zoomies and stuff. I do want to come up with any actual story to tell that happens to involve him. Here in Puerto Rico they do some really small film festivals around and it would feel so cool to show this film on those small festivals and have people watch it with me. I just want to make something good enough to show to some people and be like yeah i make short films. Im also a male in his 20s with a rabbit so Ive been thinking about random scenes that could be in the film. Something thats happened to me often is people saying stuff to me like “ i would have never expected you to say you have a rabbit, i have ate rabbit before” . people have made a lot of comments about how they wanna eat him or that they find it strange that i have a rabbit as a pet. Anyway I was hoping some creative person was inspired by the idea of a short film with a rabbit and maybe they could tell me some kind of plot i could turn into a short film.","label":0}

I’m an educated classical musician and I have spent the past 4 years as a full-time professional working with various symphony orchestras in Northern Europe. I have been looking into changing career paths for a while and have now been hired as a PA at a Danish movie production company.

Therefore I wanted to hear advice on how to do that in the best way possible. I know that visas are very difficult to attain, so I wanted to hear if there are any courses, schools to study at etc., where I would be able to get experience in some form within the production world in the US.

{"text":"[REDDIT] Final image + how it was lit: one light source, CRLS, and a 4x4 bounce (Shot on Kodak 35mm 5219) Lately, I’ve been drawn to lighting as minimally as possible. It saves time — but more importantly, sometimes it just works better for the scene. We used the CRLS system to extend and soften the practical fluorescents, gaining about half a stop of directional exposure without sacrificing the natural feel. The extra half stop makes a big difference when comparing the barebones wide to the closeups. A 4x4 bounce floated between setups, helping to wrap light or lift shadows as needed. We shot on Kodak 5219 (500T), rated at 320 ISO and exposed one stop under for this scene.

{"text":"[REDDIT] The Dreaded Comments Section Decently new channel here, I have a handful of videos and they actually have a good amount of views per video (couple thousand on average) and get good comment engagement. I primarily make videos about Super Smash Bros and challenge-type videos. I actually don’t have the usual rude or negative content that often, but not a lot of positive ones either. I know the comments section is a godless wasteland and is the last place you should go for positivity. Few viewers tell me what they like or want more of (they do in my polls though), just a lot of Super-fans of each franchise within Smash telling me I underestimated their character or left out key details and it’s becoming exhausting telling people I don’t know everything about 89 characters. Obviously I try to improve with new information every video but has anyone else experienced this very specific thing? It seems like most of my audience takes this content way too seriously. I even state that it’s more or less a comedy channel and it’s bumming me out that they all hyper-fixate on one aspect of it. Like imagine watching a Jontron video and saying, “Ummm, he’s not taking into consideration Darth Vader’s canon powers” or “Flex tape isn’t actually supposed to be used for that purpose” but being very serious about it. Do you know what I mean? It’s like I was “blessed” with the most autistic audience on YouTube (that was mostly a joke, don’t cancel me 😉)","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] [For Hire] Remote copywriter for blogs, social media captioning, and more. I'm getting worried and desperate tbh. Does anyone need a writer for their blog, business website, or practically anything else along these lines? I've been copywriting for over a decade, but unfortunately most of that writing was ghostwriting and so I don't have a lot of proof online. I do currently have a website where I write movie reviews, but I'm not contracted for that on a regular and dependable basis. The site is Geekspeak Radio and I write under Veeeee... for anyone who'd like to see how I write. My last article was a spoiler review of the movie \"Companion,\" published on May 7 this year. I'm also open to critique so I can improve and become more hire-able, or just really good. I'll write at a base rate of $0.10 for articles that need moderate research, and I'm open to pricing per article as well at $55 for 1,000 words. Are my rates reasonable? Is there anything anyone can suggest to help me get back to work? I was formerly working on Upwork and had a long-term client from there as well as the additional random ones. I've also been searching on LinkedIn and honestly it looks like all the places I got clients from have either dried up, or aren't hiring people from my country (Kenya). I can also work as a VA and a chat assistant/chatter, starting at $15 an hour, depending on hours, complexity of work, and other relevant variables. These are also roles that are unavailable when I look for them but that I have experience in. The jobs have to be remote because I'm doing the most... I know I chose that and don't expect sympathy for that, but I'm good with my time management and remote jobs also mean a wider pool to trawl, better returns and stuff. I'm tired and sad and broke and I want to change all that. Even if everything's going to sh^t. I appreciate any help and positivity I can get.","label":0}

I’m mainly doing vlog style videos but also want to capture ambient sounds and sometimes specific noises (a car for example). I was originally thinking a shotgun mic, but I saw the zoom h1 and apparently you can record ambient sounds and use the lav at the same time? Would something like that be the perfect all around device or should I look for something else. I’m on a budget and only want one recording device since I’m on my feet and traveling and don’t need a lot to carry or work with.

{"text":"[REDDIT] Song inspiration please I occasionally like to make a cinematic video (typically travel/landscape) for which I plan the shots/edit based on a specific song which inspires me, rather than the other way around.

Think Hans Zimmer - Time, Cark Orrf - O fortuna. Then leads into a properly eurporic and joy filled song. Think Sigur Ros - Hoppilpolla, Imagine dragons - on top of the world. I ideally want a song which leaves hairs standing on end. The closest I can come is some of M83s work, but keen for other suggestions! Any genre is fine so long as the emotion fits","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Please help me with workflow and file organization Hi folks, the TL;DR here is that I'm interested in hearing how others manage their clips. Also, I'm working in Da Vinci, but this question applies to any app. I'm very slowly learning how to edit properly, and I'm thinking that my current file organization system is bad. I make Counter-Strike highlight reels, and I've been capturing clips using Shadowplay's retroactive record feature (I forget what it's called). The benefit to this is that every clip is pre-cut to the good part, but the HUGE downside is that these clips pile up very quickly and take up a ton of space. So I figured OBS would be a better option, and it does in fact somehow record an entire match in about the same HD space as a single Shadowplay clip -- I don't really know how that works, but that's the topic of another post. The downside, though, is that now I have to go through the whole thing and bin all the clips out. What I'm struggling with, really, is how to separate clips out for different videos, since I might want to use a mix of different matches for a given video and save some for later. How do you folks do it? And how do you back up your projects? Do you copy the project file somewhere or just keep them all saved where they land? Thanks in advance for any help :)","label":0}
{"text":"[REDDIT] Finally Going to Try and Start. I’ve said for years I want to create a YouTube channel. I’m pretty tech savvy and should have done this while getting my engineering degree in college over 10 years ago (would have been less saturated). I’ve randomly recorded dyi things around the house, gaming clips, etc… saving them to an album on phone or other devices to use “one day” when I create a YouTube channel. My goal is to eventually have multiple channels. One for diy, homesteading (we haven’t started this yet but will record every step along the way), gaming, and maybe others down the road. I’m a perfectionist and often get the analysis paralysis. Between thinking I need all the filming equipment, software, studio setup, workstation for editing, and very busy family (wife and 3 kids) + crazy work schedule; this has always been a “one day” goal. Well, my brother and I usually play call of duty for about 2 hours together online (live in different states) when everyone goes to bed. After almost a year of doing this every night, I finally decided to start saving some game play and starting a channel. I still have to over come the perfectionist issue as u want awesome edits etc… but don’t have the time software and equipment to do it. So I’ve decided to essentially just brute force it and upload random clips with minimal to no edits with the thought being just get it started. I plan to do this over and over with no real big crazy rush to monetize or anything, just build a large library and hope some will find it and be attracted. I’m not a professional gamer/streamer, absolutely am not a cheater (quite obvious if you watch my clips), I don’t show my face (only because I play in the living room without a studio and can’t be too loud), but do have some pretty funny moments and some times pull off something epic. Anyways, my goal is to eventually be able to monetize and outsource the editing. I’m too much of a perfectionist to do it myself and would spend too much time editing and not enough time gathering content and it would take away from family time. Hopefully I’ll be there one day but for now I’m enjoying the ride and watch the analytics every now and then give me a confidence boost.","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] How Can I Make Your Life Easier With Raw Footage As a Camera Operator that will deliver raw footage to an editor, what can I do to make your life easier to work with and more efficient on different projects? My Main Questions are: \\- For Documentary/Event Work, do you prefer short clips of the key action or want to scrub through longer takes even if the camera is adjusting? \\- How long would you like a BROLL clip to be on average? \\- What are your favorite color spaces and codecs to work with for each style of project? For example would Raw be too much for a short quick turnaround documentary or would Log be ok? \\- How would you like files/folders named and different frame rate footage categorized? \\- What do you want to see on an editor's note? \\- For Interviews and Sitdown Interviews for social would a slate actually be helpful or is it not really worth it for shorter projects. \\- Is a shotgun worth setting up or a clean lav good enough for most scenarios?","label":0}
{"text":"[REDDIT] Need advice on project Basically, I'm hoping to create a few advertisement style videos to try and see if my bosses will give digital display signage a try within stores. I'm not going to make out I'm a pro at this but I have had some editing and video creation experience in the past so I'm good on the basics. I've already created a short 10 second 2D animation using Adobe Animate using PNG images so was looking to do something a little more ambitious to try and sell the idea. The idea is to pan up the product before zooming out with it on the 1st third line on the left and have the company's logo and the price show up on the right. Downside is until our meeting in July, and I have no way to communicate this to them until then. This means I can't take any of the products home and have no where to film so was wondering if there's a way to do this with PNG images. I Know it's going to look rough and no where near the professional level of the Ad's that you'd normally see on digital signage, but I'm just wondering if it's possible, and a little help bringing it fruition if it is.","label":0}

This is a personal project and not intended for resale or public distribution. This personal portfolio website project is to promote employability by showcasing my awards/certifications, background, written blogs, etc. I want the layout, animations, scroll behaviour, mobile responsiveness, cursor effects, transitions, and visual fidelity etc etc to match the original site precisely. Every detail should be preserved as closely as possible, from the intro animation to the way images transition on scroll or hover. The only things that should change are the name, and the addition of one extra page: an \"Awards\" page that lists all of my certifications. This page should include a horizontally scrolling (right-to-left) marquee section displaying each certification in a simple, clean format, and below it, a grid of all of my certifications/badges, and an option to view the actual certificate. Apart from that, everything else should remain visually and functionally the same. The site I have linked above uses the Svelte framework and I would prefer it to be used. I’m offering fixed payment for this work. I would prefer to pay 100% upon completion once I’ve seen a fully functional preview of the site hosted on your own domain, or locally on your system. The total price is negotiable and will depend on your experience, skillset, and how closely you can replicate the original site to spec.I If you require a small percentage upfront to get started, I’m open to that as long as the rest is paid after successful delivery. Payment will be made via PayPal (Goods & Services) or Bank Transfer — no crypto, period. I am open to installment payments as below: 33% upon first deliverable/milestone. 33% upon completion. 33% upon delivery. The final deliverable should include either either a downloadable ZIP with the full source code, or a private GitHub repository. Please message me or comment with links to your portfolio, GitHub, or any similar projects you’ve worked on. I would very much prefer live/demo sites that you have made. Let me know what tech stack you’d use, how long you expect the job to take, and your price for the full build. Thanks. Looking forward to working with someone who can deliver clean, accurate, high-quality frontend work.","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Not a small channel, but struggling in terms of relevancy. Want to try promotion but hear bad things Our channel has 230,000 subs which are mainly attributed to us making live action content on COD Zombies (COD Zombies in real life), but the problem is that we stopped posting for a bit and are now trying to regain our relevancy with little success. We’ve had some moderate success and a dedicated base, but we’re barely able to pull the numbers we did before and we’ve been back posting for a year. A lot of the issue we face is content creation within a niche community that has lost relevancy. Our first big video was at 19 million views and the sequels all passed 1 million. We just recently posted another sequel years later and it’s basically stopped at 50k. Essentially we have a lot of ghost subscribers I feel. People who subbed for a type of content they no longer watch. Our production value has significantly increased with better costumes, better edits, better equipment, and I’ve taken the time to essentially do every step that is advised on: engage with your core audience, make videos on relevant trending topics, make engaging thumbnails, create shorts from your bigger videos, post on multiple platforms, etc. I’ve come to call what I’m stuck in as the “nostalgia channel” phase. You’re remembered fondly for a video or an era of content with a lot of positive feedback, but have lost all sense of relevancy. Similar to like a meme everyone loved and then forgot weeks later. So this comes to my question. Is it worth promoting my videos as a large channel on YouTube promotion? I hear a lot of people advise against it for smaller channels, but I’m curious what the thought is for larger channels? Essentially I know these are fake views or subscribers, but I’m wondering if it can at least be used as a kickstart to put our video in front of my inactive subscribers. I got a window into how people view us when a short of ours went semi viral on tiktok with 800k views. Most comments talked very positively about us and saying they wish we still created, which tells me people want to see our stuff, but we’re not being pushed at all by the algorithms. We’re diversifying our content also while also keeping true to our core base. I’m at a point where I’m trying everything. While I am grateful for the fact we do have dedicated fans, it’s disheartening to spend months making costumes and thousands of dollars to pull maybe a single percentage of what we used to pull. I have a ton of passion left and don’t want to spend my life talking “the good times”. I just feel I need a kickstart, something to help push our relevancy again. Happy to hear any and all suggestions and hopefully this can maybe help smaller creators also. Thank you for reading.","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Views stuck at 150? Your first 0.8 seconds is killing you (Here’s how to fix it) Been diving deep into Shorts growth lately — not just views, but why some reels hit and others die at 93 views. Turns out, 90% of the problem isn’t content quality. It’s the first 0.8 seconds. If your intro doesn't trigger curiosity, movement, or emotion immediately, the scroll continues. No matter how valuable the actual video is. What I’ve seen work consistently: - Start with motion (walking, turning, flipping something — anything that “moves” the eye) - Say something that opens a curiosity loop fast - Bold, fast captions — design them for silent scroll Not trying to pitch anything here.

{"text":"[REDDIT] Not 'new' per se, but channel has doubled in subs over the last week after shifting niche. What should I expect to follow? And should I dual-wield niches, or just stick to one Asking out of sheer curiosity here. Channel has rocketed up from 350 subs to 740 in the last week, owing to my latest video which is a compilation of trains arriving and leaving from a station. Fairly simple stuff. Been going with this channel since 2018. Primarily car content, Forza based, with the odd video about trains over the years. Recently went full tilt into UK Rail content after dabbling in it back in 2024 (yes I like trains, sue me) and those videos have done wonders so far. 7K views in 8 days and my latest video is now my 2nd Most Viewed, apart from a random stream highlight from the Fast X Premiere, which got 64K views. I plan to continue on this path seeing as its working and I enjoy filming them go by whenever I'm out on the rail network...but I also wanna keep doing the Forza stuff, which is more edited/essay-form. The last one of those I did ended up at 6K views with high comment levels. The train videos though—less comments but higher like count. My channel has never had a singular focus, and I don't care whether the videos do well or not, its always been a passion channel. Was just surprised at how well this latest video did, really.","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Software Solutions for Managing Complicated Folder Structure & Backup Across Multiple Drives? I'm working on building out my production file and folder organization, and have hit a snag on setting up a template with automated behavior across multiple drives - and I'm hoping y'all might have experience with some solutions that could make it all work for me... The diagram above shows the general idea of what I'm trying to achieve. I've got everything from the Project SSD to the left solved (by having the NAS automatically backup anything that gets put in the parent folder that the project folder gets created in on the Project SSD; and then having the Cloud Service set to back up anything on the NAS). But what's got me stumped is: 1) The selective folder duplication to the Working SSD & Cloud 2) The dual-way sync needs for the Cache, Assets, and Documents folders (so that both sides are watching each other and will duplicate files no matter which side they're dropped) Post Haste is an amazing solution for setting up the main folder structure on the Project SSD, but I can't find any feature where it will do the selective folder duplication, nor can I figure out how to automatically set certain folders to have the dual-way sync setup as they are created. My actual folder structure is much, much more complicated than the diagram, so that's why I'm trying to find a way to avoid digging into the project file structure to manually copy and connect the necessary folders everytime I have a new project. I hope that all makes sense. Thanks so much for taking the time to ponder on this with me :)","label":0}
{"text":"[REDDIT] Bringing old family videos back to life, has anyone had success with AI upscaling? Hey everyone, I've been on a mission lately to digitize and improve the quality of some really old family videos, talking grainy VHS tapes and early digital camera footage. The quality is pretty rough, lots of noise and blur. I've tried some basic editing software, but it only does so much. I've heard a lot about AI video enhancers lately. Has anyone here used one for restoring old, low-quality footage? I'm curious about the results people are seeing, especially for things like making faces clearer or generally de-noising really degraded video. I tried out something called Aiarty Video Enhancer that claims to do a lot of this, even with audio denoising. Has anyone tried that specifically, or have other recommendations for bringing those cherished memories back to life with better clarity?","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] \"Niche down\" is the worst YouTube advice, be careful This might be controversial, but I truly think that niching down might be the worst youtube advice I see people pushing. In most cases you're just setting yourself up for failure in the long run. What I mean by niching down is when you target your entire channel to a specific segment of the total YouTube audience. I do not necessarily mean people who make videos about the same general topic. I guess you could technically call that niching down (and even that does have its issues), but what I'm talking about more is people who target a very specific segment of the youtube audience. The common advice is to find a corner of the internet where there is not a lot of competition and good amount of demand, and be the person who fills that gap in the market. Here's the thing, yes you can blow up much easier by doing this, because you basically don't have to compete with anyone and you will get consistent views by being the main channel in that space. It works for quickly blowing up, but in the vast majority of cases, your channel will fall off just as fast as it blew up. There are exceptions, but it's the most likely scenario for a number of reasons. **(1) You will run out of intetesting video ideas and things to make content about.** The more specific you get with your channel, the quicker you will be completely tapped out of interesting content to make. Note that I said interesting content. Because with any niche you could probably make 100s and 100s of videos, but how many of those will actually be interesting enough to attract large amounts of viewers? **(2) Other people will start copying your video ideas and topics.** If your videos start doing well because you filled some gap in the market, it's only a matter of time before other channels come in and start copying you. And if the only advantage you ever really had was covering in demand topics that nobody else was covering, guess what, other people will be able to cover them as good or better than you, and they will take up some of your market share. You might still get views, but it will be A LOT less than when you first blew up **(3) The specific niche you carved out will become less popular, and you're left making videos for a smaller and smaller total audience.** **(4) You have a high liklihood of experiencing burn out.** I don't care how passionate you are about that thing, if you keep making videos about the same specific thing over and over again, you will start to get tired of it. # **What should you do instead?** I am not saying you should just start making random videos about everything you're interested in. You can if you want, but it's very hard to do that. So here's the thing, niching down can help you get the ball rolling and get your channel off the ground. So go ahead and niche down at first, but you basically have to be able to escape the niche you put yourself in. And by escape the niche that doesn't mean do a 180. Let's say you started off covering one video game. Your end goal should be to become someone who is known for covering video games in general. And then eventually someone who just has fans for your personality and video style where you can make videos about other things besides games and still get views. So how do you escape your niche? Well the more you pigeon hole yourself into that niche, the harder it's going to be. Even if you have a niche at first, you should still be testing the waters every now and then with stuff outside your specific lane. This doesn't mean just do something super random, but try something similar to your niche with overlapping audience, but different enough that you're broadening your channel. Now the number one easiest way to do this - make videos about trendy stuff. I know it sucks trying to chase trends and don't do it every video. But trends are the easiest way to get views. If a topic is trending, you make a good enough video about, you will likely see huge view surges from new viewers that you would not be getting for more general or evergreen type of content. It is good to also have evergreen stuff for long term views because trendy videos die super hard after the first few weeks. So a mix of both is good. Anyway this post ended up being way too long, but I really hope some of you guys don't make the mistake of pigeon holing yourself into a small corner of the internet that is not sustainable. Don't do thst to yourself","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Go make a movie As near as I can tell the one thing that holds back fledgling filmmakers is that they do know what a movie is but they don't know what a story is. A story is a day in the life that becomes a unique problem that is resolved in the end. Consider *Night of the Living Dead*, where we start with Barbara and her brother at the cemetery and then a ghoul that moves like a zombie attacks them, and Barbara escapes to a house. The final resolution to her story is that Barbara gets killed by ghouls that move like zombies, one of whom is her brother. Have someone do something they do all the time, challenge them, and have them face the challenge and either overcome it or succumb to be subjugated by it or learn to live with it or run away from it or be killed by it. Your first movie will not be great. Accept it. Make that first movie and then make your second movie. DO NOT let your lifelong dream movie passion project be your first movie. Learn to paint before painting a masterpiece and learn to make movies before making your masterpiece. Make practice movies. Get the feel for it. Get in the flow of it. The easiest visual story is to clean something that is dirty or rearrange something that is in disarray. It is dirty. It takes work to clean it. In the end it is clean. This is carried to near extreme levels in the first episode of *Jeeves and Wooster*, but the story is that Wooster's regular life is aloof and messy, a new valet is engaged to start this morning, and he cleans up the house and then cleans up hungover Wooster. https://youtu.be/rNiq7jrdYXY?si=iePSkneu4QXIXWiC Dirty becomes clean. Amazing! Anyway, here's a kid filmmaker in 1968: https://youtu.be/7J1qZdD95TM?si=HYgmg6q-s3GuI6BR Here's some kid filmmakers in the 1970s: https://youtu.be/7J1qZdD95TM?si=9xQBCJ6HnQXzULyA You must understand that the tools you have, probably all in one device, in your hand right now, are good enough to make a decent movie. A movie need not be a feature film or fifteen minutes or epic or psychologically deep, and it does not have to look like a million bucks. Look at Troma. Go make a movie.","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] (Help) YouTube Reach, Suggestion, Views, Watchtime All Down After One Copyright Claim? I have a YouTube channel created back in 2017. I used to upload animation/text/image/slideshow-based long videos on topics like TV channel updates, TV program updates, DTH updates, satellite tracking, etc. I was feeling shy to make facecam videos or even use voiceover, and during that time I was also busy with my studies and other skill development, so I ended up uploading silent videos only. Eventually, I stopped uploading completely, and my last video was in 2021. Now it’s June 2025, and I’ve started getting a little time, so I thought of experimenting again and uploaded new videos and Shorts on that same channel. It already has 12,000+ subscribers. Surprisingly, even though the channel was inactive, it wasn’t fully dead - some old videos were still getting regular views which was very less. But loosing subscribers. So for the last 15 days, I started uploading daily again - mostly TV program updates and BTS clips (both Shorts and long videos). The response was amazing. In just 15 days, I got 85K+ total views, 250+ hours of watchtime, and 150+ new subscribers. The Shorts were doing especially well, getting pushed through search and feeds. But 3 days ago, I uploaded a Short that had a 7-8 second Bollywood song playing in the background (it was part of the original audio clip I found on social media, so didn't removed it). I added non-copyrighted music on top of it, but YouTube still detected the Bollywood audio and blocked the video worldwide during upload - even before it get published. I used the “Replace Audio” option with a YouTube Audio Library track and the claim + block got removed instantly. But I didn’t publish that video after that. Instead, I uploaded another Short (already edited for future upload). No copyright issues, but strangely, that Short didn’t even get 5 views in 6 hours, which was super unusual. I uploaded another one in the evening - same issue. No reach, no views, no impressions. Now it’s been 4 days, and I’m uploading quality Shorts daily like before, but all are getting stuck at 7, 12, 35, 59 views max. Only 1 Short got around 126 views in 4 days. Earlier I used to get 500+ views in the first hour itself, sometimes 2K-4K in a day. Even my other long videos and shorts that were getting regular views have slowed down. Did that blocked copyright claim (even though resolved) somehow affect my channel’s reach or trigger a limit from YouTube's algorithm? What should I do now? Please help. I’m totally confused. 😓","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Could These Videos Help Me Land a Role in Film or Docs? Hey folks, So I’ve been making these mini doc-style videos all by myself — I write the script, do the voiceover (english is not my first language), edit, animate, add sound effects… pretty much everything from start to finish. I’m still pretty new to all this and kinda figuring it out as I go, but I’ve been really enjoying the process, especially the editing and After Effects stuff. Lately I’ve been wondering — with the kind of work I’m doing, is there any chance of finding paid gigs in the film or documentary space? Or maybe even a role where these skills are actually useful? I don’t have a film background or anything, just been learning by doing — so I’m curious if anyone’s taken a similar path or has any advice. Appreciate any thoughts!","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] [hiring] realistic dystopian book cover, 8.5 x 11 size, digital, done within next month or two, budget 100-500 USD Heyy! I'm looking for an illustrator or artist who can create a realistic image similar to the ones above. They are in fact AI generated, but of course i'd never use them in place of what real artists can do even better. I will gladly pay an artist for a solid book cover! It doesn't have to be the same as the images above of course, just needs to stay in that vibe (brutalist, heavy fog, industrial, meat packing, factory line of people in background, dystopian, vague, secretive, etc.) since it has to fit the storyline of the book (obviously). If you have any questions at all please please please DM me and shoot me a chat, i'd love to discuss! Before messaging me though, make sure you have a portfolio i can look at that has at least a somewhat similar art style to the photos above. The size of the image, price, and deadline are all negotiable. If something is difficult for you or doesn't work, just let me know! **FOR MODS** The images above are generated by AI, however I am not looking to hire an AI \"artist\", I am not selling any kind of AI art or commission based AI material, and I will never use any art from real artists for any kind of AI database. If this still violates the rules, let me know and I can promptly take it down. Thank you!!","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Miniatures or CGI for indie sci-fi space film? I plan on making a science fiction film with grand settings in space. One example would be a floating island in space. The film will be short, with around 5-10 locations. I plan to set up a green screen studio in my living room and shoot my actors and then composite them onto the either miniature or cgi set, which is also great for scheduling and time constraints. However, I am not sure which route to go for either doing miniature practical work or making cgi renders. Which one is the best looking, easiest, cheapest and more realistic option? If miniatures ill spend money on buying supplies and then I can just have myself and friends build the sets, but if its cgi ill have to hire a professional 3d modeler. I have decent skill and experience in compositing and some knowledge in cgi blender compositing but not enough to do on my own. What do you guys recommend? Also most of the shots will be static, still images and the film is not action heavy, more existential arthouse style.","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Anyone here successfully revived a dead YouTube channel? Hey everyone! I’m currently trying to bring my old YouTube channel back to life. I created my channel back in 2020 for uploading among us videos. Then I actually got bored and quit. I used to post videos randomly after that without any goal. Now I just have enough free time to start uploading videos. But the recent videos that I uploaded haven’t been performing well — low views, barely any interaction from old subs, etc. I just don't know if it is because I switched games(kinda experimenting )or I am just really bad at creating content. My short videos kinda get some views but longer video just sucks. I wanted to ask: Have any of you tried reviving a \"dead\" channel? If yes, what worked for you? Did you change content style, post frequency, titles/thumbnails, or start a new channel altogether? I’d really appreciate hearing about your experience, even if it didn’t work out — I’m trying to learn from as many real stories as possible! Thanks in advance :)","label":0}

SO lets think about big YouTubers and how long does it take for them to get visible on youtube , in one year i can attract 200 subs and i know i chose the hardest niche in youtube lifestyle vlogs","label":0}
{"text":"[REDDIT] I just hit 7,000 views in 11 hours….and still feel like I failed. I’m an indie creator making original songs with AI tools – I write, compose, design, and edit everything myself. This video, Burning Dream, is one of my most personal works. I poured my soul into the music, the rhythm, and the emotion. But when it went semi-viral, I felt… empty. Almost no likes. No comments. No real connections. Just numbers. It made me wonder: What does success really mean in this world of endless scroll? Still, I believe in the message behind this piece — That every spark of passion matters, even when no one notices. If you’re curious, you can find the full version on my profile. And if you’ve ever felt the same, I’d love to hear from you.","label":0}
{"text":"[REDDIT] How to signed to a roster as a director? Hey everyone - my first time posting here. I have a dream of being signed with Iconoclast or Somesuch, but I can't quite figure out yet - as a director - how to walk that path. Currently, I am lacking the insight at the moment on what it takes to get signed on such a roster; would it mean making constant quality work? Do you already need to bring in big clients? I'm working on my second film now which I'm also planning on sending to said spaces - but I also don't know if this is frowned upon for example. I rarely hear people speak on this side of things and thus it remains opaque to me. I understand that no path is linear and there are many ways but I guess I am trying to gain more insight from folks in the industry who are / have been / are about to get signed in order to understand the process in general more. Also wondering if being signed is really all that it's shaped out to be, how it changed your work / income and how to continue. Edit: I want to add on that I would like to get signed on to make commercials & music videos - while also doing more lengthy work eventually like documentaries and series. I currently have no interest / dreams of making full on feature films. I have a film up at Criterion Channel at the moment which is an art film; my second film which I'm currently working on will be an experimental short between 10-15 minutes with a voice over. Thank you for your time + look forward to your answers! PS. I'm based in Europe.","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] I'm building a full studio for cheap, what are your home studios? My YouTube channel has been kind of popping off lately (not trying to self-promote, won't list the channel name) so I rented a cheap garage and I'm turning it into what I think is just about the cheapest possible full featured studio (set, sound, lighting, and camera) that money could buy. Lighting, sound deadening, video gear, everything is being acquired for less than a birthday party at Chuck E Cheeses. I'm planning on doing a video about the creation of it, so I've come here to learn about your own setups! What I'm building is far from ideal, kind of jank, and relize pretty heavily on AliExpress. I certainly wouldn't recommend doing this by any stretch, and I wanted to hear about your own setups so I could learn from them, and I also want to compare my discount setup to them, while also informing my viewers what a REAL studio should actually be compromised of. It doesn't matter how much you have or have not spent on your setups, I'd love to hear about them! For reference, here is the setup (can't show pictures because property management gave me the wrong key... So I won't be able to set it up until Monday) Video camera, targeting reasonable 1080p, three options: A: Pixel 6p (most people have a phone that can record video already, so I'm counting this as free) B(new): $230 on an NBD S210, can shoot real 4k, but video is muddy. Eeehhhhhh 1080p, can be made halfway decent with lots of work and manual focus C(used): $240 Sony PMW-EX3, really beat up, but works. Excellent quality 1080p Lighting: Two AliExpress soft boxes and 6 foot tripods, picked up for $35 combined. 1500 lumen 5500k LED bulbs from Dollar Tree Overhead 1500 lumen 6500k LED, also from Dollar Tree Then for edge lighting I have two ring-ish lights from, you guessed it, Dollar Tree. Total spent at DT: about $10 Set: Mostly furniture I've got from the trash, revarnished with varnish I got from the trash, decorative set pieces either free various online marketplaces, or dumpster dived. Several filing cabinets were purchased for $5 each, totaling $30 spent on the set Sound: Lapel microphone: $50. Camera microphones as backup. Sound deadening material, some purchased from AliExpress for $50, and others cobbled together using packing foam with free marketplace blankets glued to them. From recent experience from a family member, a birthday party for 12 kids, If you get the best package, it is $35 per kid. This comes out to $420 (nice), assuming none of the kids get anything extra whatsoever. This is already locked in, so although I certainly wouldn't mind feedback on the admittedly questionable choices I've made for the budget, I'm more interested in hearing what actual professionals have in their own setups!

{"text":"[REDDIT] I shot my first \"talking at the camera\" vlog about making stuff that sucks in order to get better. Advice welcome! Shot on FX3 in SLog3/SGamut3.Cine on the Sigma 28-70 f2.8. Color graded in Resolve using Phantom LUTs and a few manual adjustments. I definitely should have used a windscreen for the mic, and for the one take I really liked, I forgot to record 32-bit float on the transmitter. Also, there was a lot of background noise, but I think I did an OK job cleaning that up. Lesson learned: check and double-check that your audio is recording. I also wish I had used a teleprompter. I was just using my iPad on the table in front of me as a prompter, but don't love the fact that I was looking up and down constantly. It looks awkward to me. Maybe next time I mount my iPhone to a magic arm with a teleprompter app going, unless someone has a better suggestion. I lit the whole thing using one woefully underpowered Zhiyun M20c 20w light when I should have really used a 100w light with an umbrella. The sad part is, I have one and didn't use it because I didn't want to be the weird neighbor setting up a 100w light on my back patio. The whole thing came together from recording to posting in <24h, so I'm not too mad about the screw-ups. I feel like my next attempt will be a lot better. Maybe I'll talk about getting over the embarrassment of photography and videography in public spaces. I'm very self-conscious about that and trying really hard to get over it, so I think that'd be a good topic to discuss. Definitely a few lessons to be learned here about how to do it better next time. But that's kind of the whole point of the video. I did it badly, but I did it, and now I know what I really need to improve on for next time. Please feel free to leave (kind) feedback on how I can improve. Like I said, I'm a total newbie at talking to the camera and really don't love it yet, but want to get better at it!","label":0}

I run a growing YouTube channel making clean, fun Shorts for a teen audience (think: skits, GRWM, light challenges. All expressive, relatable content with tight pacing and big emotional beats). Right now, I’m doing all the editing myself, and it’s just not sustainable. I’m looking for an assistant editor – someone who can handle **rough cuts...** not final edits. I’ll still handle final polish, but I need someone with: * A good eye for telling stories and selecting the best moments * A clean and experienced Premiere Pro workflow * Strong timing and organization **What You’ll Do:** * Edit short-form rough cuts (6–20 seconds each) - It's volume shorts, not long-form right now. * You’ll receive the footage * You’ll find and screen-record the reference audio * Sync it, cut it tight, and organize the project clearly * Add a LUT and light color — no captions or SFX needed * Send it to me for feedback / revisisions * Must use Premiere Pro (no CapCut, this is a real opportunity) **What I’m Offering:** * $140 for a batch of 20 videos * $420 for 60, etc. * Weekly, ongoing work * Clear instructions and fast communication * Long-term, low-drama partnership if it’s a fit What I'm asking for takes me around 20 - 30 minutes per on average. At this point, I need an assistant to rip out ALL the edits after each shoot. Some videos are literally 1 takes and you just apply the LUT, etc. Some will be more involved and take more time. It averages out and this is a long term opportunity with a LOT of room for growth. **If You’re Interested:** Drop a reply or DM with: * A few examples of short-form edits you’ve done -- I'm not interested in CapCut zooms and text. I'm looking for timing, pacing, emotion, & storytelling. * Confirmation you use Premiere Pro * How many videos you could handle each week Thanks for reading — this will be a solid side hustle (or more) for the right person.","label":1}

{"text":"[REDDIT] Maono PD300x stream mic Review Disclaimer: I was sent this product free in exchange for a review. Moana had reached out to me from seeing my posts here and sent me the maono pd300x and the wave t5 lavalier mic. I really liked the wireless lav but it's applications were limited since i didn't always need them But the pd300x has been my daily driver since i got it. Prior to this i had used a Presonus Pd-70 which I'd been using since it released. The pd300 can connect via USB or xlr which is nice if you already have an interface. When connected to usb you get a bunch of really nice built in features from the mics app like noise cancellation, eq profiles, gain controls. All of which can also be controlled directly on the mic itself. I did find however that using the built in app vs my own plugins in obs tended to be a good deal heavier on my cpu which can at up to 10% more cpu usage vs the nearly 2% that my dedicated vsts use. The mics interface is capable of 192kHz/24bit which they claim helps make your voice more clear. And thats not really true nor how that works. Most music you listen to is generally recorded 44.1-96kHz. If you are recording an orchestra with this mic you might be able to utilize that frequency range but otherwise is overkill. I tested the mics input and was able to catch sounds near it's Nyquist frequency which is around 96kHz Not that i could hear that lmao, i used a sine wave generator and some high end audio speakers to do this. Tho it could have been just catching ambient background noise. The actual audio quality is rock solid, I like the pd300x audio profile a good deal more than the pd70. The pd70 tended to be a bit too bright for my liking, which isn't a bad thing but just a preference. The mic in usb mode is damn easy to use, it being my first usb mic i was impressed with how easy setting it up was. Just a reminder i have an audio interface and have run all my mics up to this point in XLR The aesthetics of the mics are really great for me. No led no colors just a black podcast mic that looks like that one podcast mic that everyone likes. Tho i do find it looks a GREAT DEAL like the pd70 more than the sm7b. This mic can be used on phones as well! however the Moano link app does not recognize the mic. It does work and most of the mics features can be controlled via the buttons and dial on the casing. There is also a headphone output if you want to use it as your full set up. I have not used in in that way at all and have nothing to say about it. But the pc does recognize it as an output, I've seen that in my audio devices menu. Anyway if you are looking for a relatively affordable Streaming mic that is easy to use and can and will scale with your audio needs. I recommend the Maono Pd300x.","label":0}
{"text":"[REDDIT] Should I make a new channel? I have a channel with over 100 subs posting anime edit shorts & other edits, but I want to do 2D/3D documentary-type content kind of like fern and also edits as well. Should I make a separate channel to do this and start from scratch there, or should I post all of them in this one channel and essentially have a head start on this type of new content I want to start posting. If I create a separate channel, I'll still post edits on this one, but I feel like it would be hard to grind subs on the second all over again. I don't know which is the better option.","label":0}

Hey everyone, I'm working on a tool that lets you create fake chat conversations and notifications from apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Tinder, and more. You can fully customize everything and then export the result as an image or a short video. No design tools or editing needed. Just set it up, preview, and export. I've seen a lot of viral content using fake message screens, so I thought this could make the process a lot easier for creators. Would this be useful for you? What features would make it better?

{"text":"[REDDIT] I have my story outline and most of the details. Thinking of hiring a screenplay writer / script consultant Hey guys, I'm shooting my first feature film in mid September to November. A few things just recently changed, including the lead actor. Some of the script was based on this actress and her artistic talents. The changes I'm making don't cause any issues with the main plot. But a lot of the details and dialogues need to change. Since it's my first time making a feature film and Engish isn't my mother tongue, I'm a bit stressed now to rewrite and have my script ready ASAP. Is it a good idea to hire a writer so that I can co-write the film? I guess the risk is that we won't see the same vision or have different tastes. And then it will be a waste of time and money. Any advice or suggestions will be highly appreciated!","label":0}

{"text":"[REDDIT] How do mid roll ads affect retention and viewership? I am new to making YouTube videos and have traditionally always just left mid rolls disabled, because my logic was kinda if I enable them people might just dip half way through when they see an ad, which would mean lower retention, which would mean video is seen less, which would mean less channel growth which is kinda my main goal But is this true? Or do people just not care about mid rolls anymore and just watch them regardless and I'm leaving money on the table? Also can you adjust the frequency of mid rolls?

{"text":"[REDDIT] amateur wedding video/hiring video editor for the content? Hi! I am getting married in august and a live videographer is out of the budget. We are still wanting a video to remember our day and have two friends with camcorders that offered them to us to use. We have both done some very simple video editing before so we could create a low quality video ourselves, but are potentially interested in hiring someone to edit the content for us. What is the range of cost for someone to edit our content? How would we go about finding someone for the one-off job? We plan on using a stand/tripod at the ceremony to record and then one of the groomsmen was very excited about the idea of getting to carry about a camcorder at the reception lol We know the sound quality for the ceremony would probably be less than ideal since we are having an outdoor wedding but I am not sure if this is something that we can change/need to worry about? also throwing around the idea that one could be close to us to pick up on sound and the other further away for the overall video.
