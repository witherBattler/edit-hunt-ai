Their portfolios look amazing: \u2192 Flashy reels \u2192 Trendy effects \u2192 Professional showreels They claim to be the best... But their content gets 200 views. Here's what they're missing: They edit videos. We need people who edit attention. The difference? They focus on making it look good, We focus on making it perform. They follow templates, We break patterns to stop the scroll. I've seen editors spend 6 hours perfecting a transition nobody will notice. Meanwhile, our editors know exactly when to jump-cut mid-sentence to create urgency. That's why most \"professional\" editors fail at content creation. They learned filmmaking, not platform psychology. So if you understand that good editing is invisible but great editing is addictive... We're hiring video editors. Not 1, not 2... But 7. At Praper, you'll edit for top creators and learn what actually makes content work. To get the application link: - Comment \"REAL\" - Send a connection request too.
